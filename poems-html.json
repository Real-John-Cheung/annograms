[{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The End of Days","text":"A snake with honey-coloured eyes survived and told what had happened, In our burning fields, Yesterday drew me with the spittle of its mouth on a charred wall, like a blackboard in front of frightened pupils. Thus you saw in me the image of my father, throwing my last pennies into the fountain of death, then sewing the buttons of his oil-green coat in the furrows of mud where you had planted seeds, arranged in the form of words, and they grew and blossomed when light rained down, warm as remorse, and again blood was made to flow on the palms of the earth. Canes grew high as poplars and we broke them to roof our refuge, and we jumped over our vein-streams to swim in our first sky. We fertilised our language with our debris. Mountains had become ripe heads for the fists of the sky and the slopes cheeks we ran down like melted ice, and at every point where the disappeared had fallen an unattainable flower sprang up, or a burning matchstick flickered before a schoolboy could close his mouth over it to put out the flame as he hurries to do his homework on forgetting fear. We will remember for a long time how we were before this harvest. Each of us will visit his own grave, carrying a whip on his shoulder, or behind his back a sickle or a knife. Time was a game. We bade farewell to our beds that had been smashed by our dreams. Gamblers offered us a moon that crumbled to dust at the touch of our fingers. Rats offered us their eyes as stars. Hunger blazed its suns behind our foreheads. Books we hadn’t read flittered down and landed on our ulcers. Great silences seeped through our bandages. No one uttered a word. The dots and signs with which we ended our lines leapt towards the words scattered about them, and all meanings changed.","author":"Golan Haji","entry_meta":"(2017)","id":0},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Merry Christmas from Hegel","text":"It was the year my brother died, I lived up north and had few friends or they all went away. Christmas Day I was sitting in my armchair, reading something about Hegel. You will forgive me if you are someone who knows a lot of Hegel or understands it, I do not and will paraphrase badly, but I understood him to be saying he was fed up with popular criticism of his terrible prose and claiming that conventional grammar, with its clumsy dichotomy of subject and verb, was in conflict with what he called speculation’. Speculation being the proper business of philosophy. Speculation being the effort to grasp reality in its interactive entirety. The function of a sentence like Reason is Spirit was not to assert a fact he said but to lay Reason side by side with Spirit and allow their meanings to tenderly mingle in speculation. I was overjoyed by this notion of a philosophic space where words drift in gentle mutual redefinition of one another but, at the same time, wretchedly lonely with all my family dead and here it was Christmas Day, so I put on big boots and coat and went out to do some snow standing. Not since childhood. I had forgot how astounding it is. I went to the middle of a woods. Fir trees, the teachers of this, all around. Minus twenty degrees in the wind but inside the trees is no wind. The world subtracts itself in layers. Outer sounds like traffic and shoveling vanish. Inner sounds become audible, cracks, sighs, caresses, twigs, birdbreath, toenails of squirrel. The fir trees move hugely. The white is perfectly curved, stunned with itself. Puffs of ice fog and some gold things float up. Shadows rake their motionlessness across the snow with a vibration of other shadows moving crosswise on them, shadow on shadow, in precise velocities. It is very cold, then that, too, begins to subtract itself, the body chills on its surface but the core is hot and it is possible to disconnect the surface, withdraw to the core, where a ravishing peace flows in, so ravishing I am unembarrassed to use the word ravishing, and it is not a peace of separation from the senses but the washing-through peace of looking, listening, feeling, at the very core of snow, at the very core of the care of snow. It has nothing to do with Hegel and he would not admire the clumsily conventional sentences in which I have tried to tell about it but I suspect, if I hadn’t been trying on the mood of Hegel’s particular grammatical indignation that Christmas Day, I would never have gone out to stand in the snow, or stayed to speculate with it, or had the patience to sit down and make a record of speculation for myself as if it were a worthy way to spend an afternoon, a plausible way to change the icy horror of holiday into a sort of homecoming. Merry Christmas from Hegel.","author":"Anne Carson","entry_meta":"(2016)","id":1},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Going Nowhere, Getting Somewhere","text":"How was it that till questioned, till displaced in the attempt to answer, I had scarcely thought of myself as having a country, or indeed as having left a country? The answer lies peripherally in looming, in hinterland; primarily in the tongueless, palpitating interiority. In the same way, some confident speakers do not think of themselves as having an accent. They will say so, I don’t have an accent. You have an accent! In those accentless voices compass points spin, ochre and ultramarine flagella fling themselves identifiably towards this that or the other region. It is a motile version of that luxury, solidity, non-reflectivity that is the assumption of patria. So different is the expat from the refugee, who has her country on her back, or the migrant, who has countries at his back. What would I have called home, before I began creating home? Before I had to learn to ravel up longitude, latitude, population, oil rigs, mobile phone masts, prayer flags, legality of fireworks, likely use of firearms, density and disappearance of forests, scarlet ibis, other stripes of scarlet, into a by-listeners-unvisited, communicable, substantial image of Trinidad’? Language is my home. It is alive other than in speech. It is beyond a thing to be carried with me. It is ineluctable, variegated and muscular. A flicker and drag emanates from the idea of it. Language seems capable of girding the oceanic earth, like the world-serpent of Norse legend. It is as if language places a shaping pressure upon our territories of habitation and voyage; thrashing, independent, threatening to rive our known world apart. Yet thought is not bounded by language. At least, my experience of thinking does not appear so bound. One day I lost the words wall and floor. There seemed no reason to conceive of a division. The skirting-board suddenly reduced itself to a nervous gentrification, a cover-up of some kind; nothing especially marked. The room was an inward-focused container. Wall’, floor’, even ceiling’, doorway’, shutters started to flow smoothly, like a red ribbed tank top over a heaving ribcage. Room grew into quarter. Room became segment. Line yearned till it popped into curve. The imperfections of what had been built or installed: the ragged windowframe or peeling tile: had no power to reclaim human attention to floor or wall as such. Objects were tethered like astronauts and a timid fringe of disarrayed atmosphere was the immediate past that human activity kept restyling into present. The interiority of the room was in continuous flow. Wall, floor became usable words again in a sort of silence. I had the sense to shut up about the languageless perception. Procedure for living. Language is my home, I say; not one particular language.","author":"Vahni Capildeo","entry_meta":"(2016)","id":2},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Children are the Orgasm of the World","text":"This morning on the bus there was a woman carrying a bag with inspirational sayings and positive affirmations which I was reading because I’m a fan of inspirational sayings and positive affirmations. I also like clothing that gives you advice. What’s better than the glittered baseball cap of a stranger telling you what to strive for? It’s like living in a world of therapists. The inspirational bag of the woman on the bus said a number of things like live in the moment and remember to breathe but it also said children are the orgasm of the world’. Are children the orgasm of the world like orgasms are the orgasms of sex? Are children the orgasm of anything? Children are the orgasm of the world like hovercraft are the orgasm of the future or silence is the orgasm of the telephone, or shit is the orgasm of the lasagne. You could even say sheep are the orgasm of lonely pastures, which are the orgasm of modern farming practices which are the orgasm of the industrial revolution. And then I thought why not? I like comparing things to other things too. Like sometimes when we’re having sex and you look like a helicopter in a low-budget movie, disappearing behind a cloud to explode. Or an athlete winning a prestigious sporting tournament at the exact moment he realises his wife has been cheating on him. For the most part, orgasms are the orgasms of the world. Like slam-dunking a glass basketball. Or executing a perfect dive into a swimming pool full of oh my god. Or travelling into the past to forgive yourself and creating a time paradox so complex it forces all of human history to reboot, stranding you naked on some rocky outcrop, looking up at the sunset from a world so new looking up hasn’t even been invented yet.","author":"Hera Lindsay Bird","entry_meta":"(2016)","id":3},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Antico Adagio","text":"Bring down the lights.

Even at the blunt end, the ochre-coloured flint, smoothed and polished, is a slim-line product. It looks like a small spatula, and would be something of a puzzle to archaeology, but speculation is pointless, rendered futile at a touch. The obliging object tells the hand exactly where it wants to go. As soon as I picked it up, the long haft made itself at home, slung between first finger and thumb on the elastic webbing of skin. The first fingerpad went straight to the back of the blade. After three thousand years of dumb neglect, the instrument was attuned, responsive, prompt to its ancient cue. The leading edge is minutely pecked. Broken small craters, overlapping scoops, were quickly opened up in the glassy stone by the same degree of force aimed repeatedly, dozens of times, at the same hard margin of a few fingers breadth. The life-knowledge of the flint-knapper dwells in the sparing of exertion at the very point of landing a blow. The effects of this knowledge, the depth and shape of indentations in the stone, are accordingly generic if not uniform. An even more precise and unthinking calculation is needed for end-on strokes that split the individual flint. At some point the maker, under the spell of making, no longer sees the use to which the blade is put, seeing instead the bloom of a new shape begin to emerge from the flint’s uncertain depths. Sometimes this shape is only poorly divined, or glimpsed and avoided; sometimes it is nursed into life, by craftsmen who watch for the ideal form of knife-being, especially if this is a votive blade, intended for ritual deposit. Best of all is when the artist, setting his sights on perfect function, sees it rise above the horizon at the same point as beauty of form. This tool for cutting was neither deposited nor lost. I think it was left beneath the roots of a broad oak with a clutter of flints, worked but unfinished, until the maker should return, and return soon. There it lay until the sea covered all the oaks whose stumps are now below the tides at Holme-next-the-Sea. Lying there through storms that uncovered the massive inverted bole of roots at the centre of Seahenge, close by, it found another hand to belabour, to switch on, to gear up, when just enough sand had been swished aside for its pale surface to draw the eye. It may never have been used, but was made for a hand that used others like it, and it would always transmit the same feeling for action, the same possible uses for butchery, severing, slicing, scraping. It was the lever between inner and outer worlds, it showed that the airs and waters, rocks and earth, moving and combining and resisting one another, obeying the spirits that ruled them, had their equivalent workings, their times of calm and upheaval, under the skin; in the wallowing lungs, the weeping flesh, the flowing heart, and in all the symmetries of bones and muscles, the asymmetries of lower organs, the random belt of the guts. It brought the cross-sections of life within grasp. Behind it, the physician’s trial and error, the surgeon’s initiative; the whole breathing, faltering body of science.","author":"Rod Mengham","entry_meta":"(2015)","id":5},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"A Woman Shopping","text":"I will soon write a long, sad book called A Woman Shopping.

This is a short talk about vectors. It’s about Brueghel’s Icarus. It’s about a girl walking home from school at the exact moment her neighbour laces up his Doc Martens, tight. It’s about a partial and irrelevant nudity. It’s about the novel as a form that processes the part of a scene that doesn’t function as an image, but as the depleted, yet still livid mixture of materials that a race riot is made from. Think of the sky. Think of the clear April day with its cardigans and late afternoon rain shower. Think of the indigo sky lowering over London like a lid. Think of Blair Peach, the anti-racism campaigner and recent emigrant from New Zealand, who will die before this day is out. Think about a cyborg to get to the immigrant. Think of a colony. Think of the red and white daikon radishes in a tilted box on the pavement outside Dokal and Sons, on the corner of Uxbridge Road and Lansbury Drive. Think of the road, which here we call asphalt, there, it is bitty. It is a dark silver with milky oil seams. A patch up job, Labour still in power, but not for long. It’s 1979, St. George’s Day, and the Far Right has decided to have its annual meeting in a council-run meeting hall in Southall, Middlesex, a London suburb in which it would be rare nauseating to see a white face. To see anyone, actually. Everyone’s indoors. Everyone can tell what’s coming. It’s not a riot, at this point, but a simple protest in an outlying area of London, an immigrant suburb: a banlieue. Everyone knows to board the glass up, draw the curtains and lie down. Lie down between the hand-sewn quilts shipped from India in a crate then covered in an outer cotton case stitched to the padding with a fine pink thread. The quilts smell of an antiseptic powder, an anti-fungal, Mars. We lie down beneath the blankets in front of the fire. It’s 1979, so there’s a small gas fire and a waist-high fridge, where we keep our milk and our bread and our cheese, right there, in the living room.

Together they mapped distant cities and willed the sea to overtake them. And when the russet tide came they opened themselves like unfamiliar lovers. The whole thing some actinic principle, a forest grew up in a second, to grace a world where the sun was a watery lamp. Where none had been before, white mouths frilled softly in the current and squat armour issued forth the unlikeliest of cilia: transparent, lightly haired, cherishing each updraft as, feathered, they moved with it.

I’d been hoping to spare you any further musings I might have had on the nature of Iain Duncan Smith, that talking claw. But perhaps we’re at a point now where we need to define him, to recite and describe, occupy his constellations. Because to recite the stations of the being of Iain Duncan Smith, as if they were a string of joy-beads, and they are, would be to recite the history of the law, if we take that law to be something as simple as a mouth is, and each noise, each syllable that emits from that mouth is only ever and never more than the sound of animals eating each other, a gap in the senses where the invisible universe goes to die, and we become like ghosts or insomniacs stumbling through the city, we become the music of Iain Duncan Smith, his origin in the chaos of animals and plants, of rocks and metals and the countless earths, where over and again he breaks children’s teeth with gravel-stones, covers them with ashes. Because to classify those stations, the cancer-ladder of the dreams of Iain Duncan Smith might, at a push, be to consume him, and to define those stations, those marks on the hide of Iain Duncan Smith, might be to trap him, to press granite to the roof of his mouth, the stations of the law. And at this point, obviously, I really wish I could think of something to say that was hopeful, that was useful, that was not simply a net of rats blocking the force of the sun, till it crawls on its fists and knees, screaming like a motherfucker, sarcastic and wrathful, boiling the mountains as if they were scars, laughing, laughing like a crucifixion, modular and bleached. Bleached with the guts of Iain Duncan Smith, of each of the modest number of words he actually understands, such as grovel and stingray and throat, chlamydia, wart. And those five words are the entirety of the senses of Iain Duncan Smith, the gates to his city, his recitation of the germs of the law, a clock that never strikes and never stops, where we are not counted, wiped from the knots of statistics, comparable to fine gold, receptacles of song, shrieking gulls.

You never really speak except for the time she makes her request and later when she tells you you smell good and have features more like a white person. You assume she thinks she is thanking you for letting her cheat and feels better cheating from an almost white person. Sister Evelyn never figures out your arrangement perhaps because you never turn around to copy Mary Catherine’s answers. Sister Evelyn must think these two girls think a lot alike or she cares less about cheating and more about humiliation or she never actually saw you sitting there.

I slammed the door shut and the catch encased in the door is now broken. The catch inside the rim is fine, and if I lodge a spoon in there it continues to function, but obviously then the door isn’t closed. I am having a nightmare finding a replacement door. I have managed to take the door off. But I can’t seem to get the door apart to remove the catch itself. A liquid sieve was slicked on mock extinct.

Love can be trusted not to fade, as also faded out to trust; devour the wind that just washes over you, its meaning is its filling; your reflection in glass blown into the shape of your face to accommodate its progressive jutting; cracks appear in your shambolic argumentative scream learnt fresh from first orgasming, a rondo to oblivion d’exécution transcendante; excess levity leads to an unblessed strain injury for the dozen or so marketing executives secretly pretending to get good enough at free improvisation; they’re out back; whatever the fuck that thought is, get it back; commissioning variations on your theme the screen blinks, Yemen for cubist; get it back; mortality is scrambled to the précis of our meaning, to make life comprehensively succinct; the immutable is better than the mutable, the inviolable is better than the violable, and the incorruptible is better than the corruptible, look at teeth, or Africa.

The fence at the corner is obscurely associated with being loved and doing the creosoting for a meagre sum which I think is a lot but is also a way of rounding into the street with your feeling of disappointment. Twigs scratch and knock on it, later redone in local colour. People are dragging back the sled. On the top the snow is packed onto the muddy grass oddly hard by all their feet. That is the efficiency of feet. People go down the mound. In the summer when the snow was gone under the mud I went there with David and ended up agreeing to be the one who was fucked so long as I did not have to be the one who would fuck back, and put myself on my hands and knees with my pants down, in front of him, facing away; I felt myself become a hole, I now think I emerged as a hole for him; I now emerge as a hole for you. We didn’t get to do it, our mothers came looking for us and stopped it even before fear did, but I suspected even then that he was frightened or just indifferently disgusted, since otherwise surely he would have done it to me quicker, since I think so; I mean that him fucking me would have come first, but not me fucking him, or our mothers; we should have made our mothers come too late; I heard that he told people about it and I was angry because I was ashamed at having again capitulated to secrecy; secrecy was my enemy, like God engrossed in someone else; in the caravan in his garden I tried pressing him to agree to one last fuck without touching with his father figure who was a man I now give a cartoon nose, white skin, a beard, and idly establish was 40. I’m colouring in his hair, it’s brown. It wasn’t love, but it hurt and left me complex; I am a real hole for you, not a barely noticeable flimsy crack; David had a stupid way of laughing and a fucking ugly blush. Hasten defections. I swapped stickers with him, and went on to exchange my motorbike for Christian’s tank, an agreement which my father unhappily replied was a sort of extortion from infancy, but which made me sexually delight in having given away more than I had got back, for the delight was secret; I made my sister wear the fantasy lieutenant’s shirt with the felt tip arrows pinned to the collar. To propitiate invasion. Nylon for Insignia. I lay under a cushion and asked her to jump on my head. She did.

To buy a potted plant is to admit both faithlessness and need. To water the plant, perhaps daily, perhaps once in a while when you remember and the leaves start to droop, is as close to love as it gets. Other things mean other things. To light a lamp is to hide darkness in the same closet as sleep, along with silence, desire, and yesterday’s obsessions. To read a book is to marry two solitudes, the way a conversation erases and erects, words prepare for wordlessness, a cloud for its own absence, and snow undresses for spring. The bedroom is where you left it, although the creases and humps on the sheets no longer share your outline and worldview. In that way, they are like the children you never had time for. A cooking pot asks the difficult questions, what will burn and for how long and to what end. TV comes from the devil who comes from god who comes and goes as he pleases. To hide the remote control in someone’s house is clearly a sin, but to take the wrong umbrella home is merely human. The phone is too white to be taunting you. The door you shut stays shut.

Death on a large scale always takes precedence and allows one to act swiftly and without guilt. I kissed my brother-in-law at my mother-in-law’s funeral, the ill-fitted plank of his torso hewn to my grief, so that afterward it was easier to be around the happy stuff everyone seemed to remember. It was all very confusing, as the radio put it, complete mayhem.

Sure, a few of them had been slapped, spit upon, held down and raked over some had been told the truth: YOU WON’T GO FAR, YOU WON’T GO ANYWHERE AT ALL. I love my daughter, the pale gloaming of her hair a minor song of my continuance. Unlike the Country Music Station, the day the news rolled in that half of the world’s population had perished, I did my chores as usual, putting the dirty clothes into the washer and removing the clean ones from the dryer as if the world could be soothed by the delicate cycle and the loving heat of my steady machine. It was as though I knew I was not going anywhere until an anticipated but still shocking chemical explosion allowed me to perish from my daughter, my swift, guiltless death an event that would bring context to her sorrow and allow her to remember, unbidden, the happy stuff, which I’m sure happened daily, like writing your name in the fog on the shower door, for example.

Sound does, for sound is pain, curled and garbled by the ganglia, stunned and suppressed, dim thundering from some secret window. Never regular, though it may sometimes seem so. Never present, though it may seem. Rivet of moment to moment. A sack on the face with holes to see. Imprecise, as a world seen through cloth, ease of the friend that follows. Agony internal to the shape. The tinier holes through which a quality refines. A private lack, a riveting in some riveting act. What does sound carry? It will not tell. It refuses to be known.

It was not so long before this that he had set out, with his boxes and pencils, eager to do some drawing. The sun had been scalding, but despite the heat transfixing him, gouging his forehead, the dusty cart road had been easy underfoot, fringed by oaks and box scrubs. It wasn’t long before he had come to a turn in the path and saw the tree, black, sickly, ancestral. By presenting itself in this way, close to the cattle wandering deep in the fields, straining to stand upright amid tightly spaced trees where shafts of light fell in a dense bluegreen, it was as if it were performing a courtesy for those passing through. And further; that it should form a stand in such a hot parched landscape suggested to him the most hopeful of signs a circle of connection, a return. He decided to sit down and draw it. Beside him he placed a jug of water and a basket of strawberries. He felt content. Thoughts of restlessness abated; his mind grew rooted and still. It was as though something inside him were slowly uncoiling, wanting to burst forth into an act of pure attention. He felt himself recede into the present as if hit by a sudden cold wave. As he begins to draw the tree seemed to arrange itself into an image of the eternity he craved rather than the brute emptiness he feared. But close up he saw something that clutches at his heart: something like a shadow, or a delayed pain, a gaze overflowing from the tree. He didn’t know what to do with that ardour overflowing from a tree. Or that gaze. Think instead of a mind trembling under its own weight, trying to glimpse its own undoing; then subtract the feeling of something formless surging on the forested floor; waiting to flow back to the source. Or you could imagine that the tree itself, trying to resist the forces that shaped it, had burrowed back into this black earth. As though it had given up on its treeness tired at last of its offices, unwilling to be woven from the earth. As though it had misread its own nature, refusing the illusion of its own form. He had engineered the encounter. He had wanted to see the tree free from artifice, whatever that may be. But it did not. It wanted nothing. Nothing at all. Better stop here. Better to simply stand, serving your purpose, waiting for the world to appear elsewhere.","author":"Marriott","entry_meta":"(2011)","id":28},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Nightmare Pink","text":"It’s raining.

When I meet others like me I recognise the longing, the missing, the memory of ash on their faces. No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark. I’ve been carrying the old anthem in my mouth for so long that there’s no space for another song, another tongue or another language. I know a shame that shrouds, totally engulfs. Allah Ceebta, I tore up and ate my own passport in an airport hotel. I’m bloated with language I can’t afford to forget. They ask me how did you get here? Can’t you see it on my body? The desert red with immigrant bodies shot in the face for trying to enter, the Gulf of Aden bloated with immigrant bodies. I wouldn’t put my children on the boat unless I thought the sea was safer than land. I hope the journey meant more than miles because all of my children are in the water. I want to make love but my hair smells of war and running and running. Look at all these borders, foaming at the mouth with brown bodies broken and desperate. I’m the colour of hot sun on my face, my mother’s remains were never buried. I spent days and nights in the stomach of the truck, I did not come out the same. Sometimes it feels like someone else is wearing my body. I know a few things to be true. I do not know where I am going, where I have come from is disappearing, I am unwelcome and my beauty is not beauty here. My body is burning with the shame of not belonging, my body is longing. I am the sin of memory and the absence of memory. I watch the news and my mouth becomes a sink full of blood. The lines, the forms, the people at the desks, the calling cards, the immigration officers, the looks on the street, the cold settling deep into my bones, the English classes at night, the distance I am from home. But Alhamdulilah all of this is better than the scent of a woman completely on fire, or a truckload of men who look like my father, pulling out my teeth and nails, or fourteen men between my legs, or a gun, or a promise, or a lie, or his name, or his manhood in my mouth. I hear them say, go home, I hear them say, fucking immigrants, fucking refugees. Are they really this arrogant? Do they not know that stability is like a lover with a sweet mouth upon your body one second and the next you are a tremor lying on the floor covered in rubble and old currency waiting for its return.

Then he threw a square of canvas over the headstone, saying, Don’t read it. It makes it personal. He did all the digging, holding the torch in his mouth as he chopped and sliced at the dirt around his feet. What the hell are you doing? he shouted from somewhere down in the soil. Eating a sandwich, I said. Bacon and avocado. Want one? ‘For Christ sake, Terry, this is a serious business, not the bloody church picnic, he said, as a shower of dirt came arcing over his shoulder. After about half an hour of toil I heard the sound of metal on wood. Bingo, he said. Then a moment or two later, Oh, you’re not going to like this, Terry. ‘What? I said, peering over the edge. Richard Dawkins’s eyes were about level with my toes. It’s quite small, he said. He uncovered the outline of the coffin lid with his boot. It was barely more than a yard long and a couple of feet wide. I felt the bacon and avocado disagreeing with one another. Do you believe in God? he said. I shrugged my shoulders. Pass me the jemmy, he said. The lid splintered around the nail heads; beneath the varnish the coffin was nothing but clean chipboard. The day I found little Harry in the bath, one eye was closed and the other definitely wasn’t. Flying fish can’t really fly. With both feet on the crowbar Richard Dawkins bounced up and down until the coffin popped open. But lying still and snug in the blue satin of the upholstered interior was a goose. A Canada Goose, I think, the ones with the white chinstrap, though it was hard to be certain because its throat had been cut and its rubber-looking feet were tied together with gardening twine. Richard Dawkins leaned back against the wall of the grave and shook his head. With a philosophical note in my voice I said, What did you come here for, Richard Dawkins? He said, Watches, jewellery, cash. A christening cup, maybe. What about you? ‘I thought it might give me something to write about, I replied. Well, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, we’ve got a murdered goose in a child’s coffin in the middle of the night, and mud on our boots. How would you finish this one? he said.

The public address plays a mumbling kind of music. The corridor becomes less crowded. A group of girls goes by. The colour of the light is like new aluminium. A sugary orange-smell carries into the air. The cups of weak coffee and the nylon-colour lighting, the noisy rows we go through and the drifting, hollow music. There is a kind of completeness to these families camping out around the restaurant, altogether different from the completeness there is in the colour of the sun, and how it swims over the floor, shifting beyond the shadows of the stools and the chairs. There is a sad kind of surprise in the way the steel-colour light takes up the space between the cafeteria and the corridor, giving an even emphasis to the low metal banisters, the pigeon-colour flooring, the wall lamps, the mirroring, the open double doors. The space itself has the feel of something imagined or something not quite recognised, like getting to your destination and feeling you are still in the place you departed from. Or like returning home and finding no house there, no street, no pavement lined with hedges, your town not even mentioned on the regional travel map. The light is like something only dimly understood. The light is like greaseproof paper. The chairs are the colour of blue chocolate-papers. The departures board is unreadable. The ceilings are low. The light is like a kind of lengthy explanation the light is like two thoughts occurring at once. The fluorescent yellow lighting in the upper-storey corridors is not absolutely like anything you remember. That feeling of sourness you get in the gut, stepping onto a descending escalator, is not unrelated to that trembling sensation that other feeling you sometimes get of actually being two places at once. This is probably something it is better not to talk about. The first thing is how much the light from the chandelier brings to mind a pan of bubbling caramel chocolate, and the other’s the way the angles of the fluorescent ceiling-tubes are like something from the diagram page of an organic chemistry textbook. Sometimes the light is a soft vanilla-colour; sometimes it is a colour like the yellow of an egg. Waiting out the morning in the roped-off restaurant area, the feeling of looseness and unreality that keeps on bringing us back to ourselves is not unrelated to the certainty we feel as we sit and watch the planes pulling off into the distance, that if we fix our eyes on the names painted along the bodies of the aircraft then we will continue to be able to read those words, never losing focus as the planes become speckles in the vivid deep blue of the sky. This is nothing much more than a trick to do with distance, like the way our childhoods fasten themselves in the memory always just so far off, so they never seem any more distant or any less real, though further and further away from us they grow. Warmth comes like a murmur, and the minutes go round. The sunlight at the windows is like honey and butter. The middle-morning sunlight, becoming bluish against the windows, creates simple shadows on the sand-colour flooring.

What I mean is I did not need to see them at all. My mother in that other era used to sit on the roof drawing the passing sky on her own. Her hair was thin, uncut, colourless.

I think it is it I talk of that occurred then between the black and the white. If anything this capital is in-between. It is painted naught, or it was. Light yellow, in January, when you look out of the train pulled by the rails, no, not too fast. Why were we both disloyal? What I mean is why do we not live in the place, no matter where, that we actually live in? We meet here three times a year waiting for each other behind bins lining the dark at night. It is cold. A January. A January just before Christmas is what I mean. It is such a Christmas is what I mean. Those bins happen at each corner. One after another you hide from me and ask me to do the same for you. There is no plan in the future and so you leave the country on Christmas day. Take the train to the border. What I mean is that border drawn between two pine-trees. They are pines of the same woods, of the same pine. In-between; take a walk in tomb-land where veterans of the Alps, of the same land of the same woods, still assemble from time to time. The bones used to be scattered. Sporadically. I see. Now - martially renovated stones - I fit my soles in your traces on a path of our sledge you used to pull in the snow. Forgive me if I don’t spend any more time with you here. What I mean is don’t I spend more time with you spending time with ghosts? Don’t blame the signs of the galleries in St Paul’s. What I mean is there are no circular walls that could bring those voices back. We left them there in that discoloured era. Or is it that they only whisper in that white coloured glass? Leave the domes troubles to the domes. And the trams to bridges that can hold them no longer. I think domes should not talk at all and should not fool their visitors who pilgrimage from far-off lands, from black and white capitals. From white glass coloured capitals. From grey capitals.

Hanging out of our fingers. The cherry paint flakes. Ringing round. The drawn daggers hit cards. All from here. 3 through the heart’s mark. Steer into each other’s legs & the waltzer & on off & on.

There was something classic in it, not the tinny precision of pre-recorded electronic farce, but a richer reality, friendly, urgent, as of a miniature cascade of harmonics, faithful but very, very remote in a neighbouring valley or a distant cell? There was only my one room. I shook myself alert, and fixed my eyes on the model watchman chess figure above the dud fire. He was only a copy of course, of some hand-worked Anglo-Norse original, perhaps three inches high, standing in fixed resin form, blank eyes pointed toward me. Yet, I thought, the sound had come - inside the room certainly - from this direction? I looked more closely, as though daring him to repeat his call to life. From the top of a round turret, the body of the watchman was in place, a veteran soldier on an easy but important duty. He had a fine moustache, flowing down into a beard; it was a cold dawn, maybe, where he lived, for he had a top tunic and also a cloak with its hood folded down behind; and a helmet, as if danger might be at hand, should be expected, as I was expecting it. The instrument was little more than a wide curve, an animal horn inverted, and the tip cleared away to admit rasping breath. The tip was in his mouth. He blew. Suddenly I saw. I dashed across the room, opened the drawer, clawed out the Christmas bauble, and launched it mercilessly out through the top window I kept open this night and every night.

I said, What caused the stars and moon to disappear and the sky to turn into a blotted sheet even on these nights clear as a rooster’s eye? I don’t know, she said. Maybe the change in the weather, or our insatiable consumption of electricity, this excessive urbanization. We light the earth and the sky disappears. You’re probably better off in India.

Such a clean is not in any sense a banishing of genitalia; it is the creation of a quiet bright mind-space that allows for the deliciousness of genitalia to become obvious. I look out over the colorful clean tables and the pretty food posters and I like people again; each has a dick and balls, or a cunt and titties, which, clean, are simply enjoyable. Naturally I think about smashing the skulls and rib-cages of the other customers. They stand in line so smug like they were safe, outside the desires of or for an other. It’s as if, for them, there is no other’s desire as if desire was one thing, and was ours. Restraining myself is not dishonest. It’s a way of maintaining a keen sense of the unforeseeable injuries which shall reunite us. If I had to say what Wendy really was if she had to be one thing instead of a field of various energies I think I’d have to say that she was a penis. Something about her face and the shape of her hair, the muffled red coherence of head and torso, and perhaps too her lack of arms and legs. A penis is founded in just such a lack of limbs; it’s really amazing when it arrives anywhere. Wendy, will you not even poke me? Not even a slow poke? I wonder why you treat me so. Am I a wooden board? Am I to be thought of as a simple wooden board? Come on, just give me a slow poke. I’m not a wooden board, honey. Come on, just poke me like you used to. Just a slow poke. Look into my eyes are these the eyes of a wooden board? I took my Frosty into the bathroom and sat it on the floor. I pulled my pants down, got down on all fours, and buried the tip of my cock in the cold brown swirl. Then I forced my cock and balls all the way into the cup, Frosty spilling on to the floor. Then I thought sexy thoughts. My erection slowly forced more Frosty on to the floor. This is the real test of a drink’s thickness. My previous statements were made in haste. I was hungry and confused, and I longed for purpose. I wanted to seem like I was in the process of focusing in on something important. I wanted to feel purpose rising like an ancient city from the excavator’s pick and shovel.

Absence is something like that. To leave evidence. I see it. By rolling the world back. The way the cat ran up the wall and escaped out of the window. The wind that came in just as the cat left knocked down everything it touched by reversing time, from the small past in which the cat had disappeared, toward the present. The wind, having substantially disturbed the proper position of a light letter on the desk, has now passed by. And it is no longer here. Jay and I are contained in the room. And yet, the room feels vacant, somehow. Am I here? Clearly exist here? I am passing through it. I will become absent. From the open window I hear the sounds of the neighbour’s house. Why aren’t you finishing your homework? The noise of plates. Would you come here and help me a bit? The noise of plates. What did you do with that? The noise of a washing machine. The soft ringing of a telephone. Hello, hello? Hello, hello? The beep signalling that the washing machine finished its work. We don’t know the faces of our neighbours. Nonetheless, they come in. Like a flood. Our neighbours daily routines, into this vacant room. Jay and I turn on music. A brief conversation. Sexual intercourse. Laughter. The sound of slapping flesh. Two people cursing each other. These noises, too, slowly go out. Toward our neighbour’s house. Unobtrusively, directly. We languidly blend with one another, with voices alone. On the ground separating us ivy leaves overgrow. The Sunday morning when I leave Jay’s room. There is Jay’s room where I no longer am. I don’t leave a single footprint, but my invisible fingerprints are imprinted everywhere. Nights, I think of the room. I peer out of the window. I see the absences of myself and the cat. Jay is a man who is part of that room. His long body tightly coiled into hardness, he, the penis of the room, is quietly asleep. I stretch my hand and touch the room. The wall is soft. I push the room harder, and the room goes out of the room. The room that contains nothing, except Jay, at first with some bounce, like a soap bubble, goes out of the hard room, slowly.","author":"Masayo Koike","entry_meta":"(2000)","id":60},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The Cough","text":"He felt an uncomfortable sensation in his throat. Perhaps his throat was struggling with words. Seated in the car next to this Japanese film director, Wilhelm began to cough. He feared the conflict going on in his throat might not stop. It might continue and interrupt their conversation in the long drive from the Japanese airport. He threw his body against the seat in an attempt to shake off his embarrassment. Allergy, said Nagao with confidence, Allergy to our film. On Nagao’s unwrinkled skin were little ribbons of smile. At the intersection of the road in Nagasaki where in Japanese films a short dark woman usually squats, Wilhelm pointed out a break between two buildings where light crept through like an oyster. He said he would like to use that oyster light. Cliche, said Nagao. Observing Nagao in his dark blue denims, he wondered if their film should be called Dark Blue Denim. He wished the noise an oyster makes could get into the film. Nagao shook his head. Better noise the eye when it blinks. Pachi Pachi in Japanese. Wilhelm suggested the sound of creaking wood for the scene of the two people lost in the garden. Pachi Pachi better, Nagao said. More subtle. The action was too slow and Wilhelm wanted a more violent crescendo. When the body fell down the cellar stairs, perhaps another body could fall on top of it? Could be liquid soap on stair, said Nagao. In the middle of a film, Wilhelm always had the feeling he was being chased. He complained that when he directed those shots up in the sky with two planes flying parallel to each other, he was also in a sky chase. Flower petals putting on the wings of a plane, suggested Nagao. Perhaps he might return to his home for awhile and the scenarist could work with Nagao. She could put her own story into the script, how she got hired, etc. Was there something going on between her and Nagao. He thought of home as a possible sequence and Home started to roll with its camera views. Home needed editing, especially the scene with his analyst when they discussed his cough that now seemed like another room in the movie. Nagao believed the film was too slow. It was old-fashioned to explain why gangsters upset the fish cart. Wilhelm disagreed and told him the fish cart was like a scene by the painter, Utamoro, a capsule of real life. He suggested a new title, Dreams of Real Life. No, said Nagao, both eyes blinking, The Cough is better.","author":"Barbara Guest","entry_meta":"(1999)","id":61},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Cinema-Going","text":"One afternoon in a cinema in the East Neuk when I was about nine years old.

I was a bit worried about Christopher Robin falling in it, but he came back and then I asked him about the well. Old bear, he answered. I was in it and was falling and I was changing as I fell. My legs became long, I was a big person, I wore trousers down to the ground, I had a grey beard, then I grew old, hunched, and I walked with a cane, and then I died.

On the tarmac, I eavesdrop on Operation Tiger, Troops will burn down the garden and let the haven remain. This is home the haven a cage surrounded by ash the fate of Paradise. Through streets strewn with broken bricks and interrupted by paramilitaries, Irfan drives me straight to the Harmonies 3 for my father the youngest brother., three houses built in a pastoral, that walled acreage of Harmonies where no one but my mother was poor. A bunker has put the house under a spell. Shadowed eyes watch me open the gate, like a trespasser. Has the gardener fled? The Annexe of the Harmonies is locked my grandmother’s cottage where her sons offered themselves to her as bouquets of mirrors. There was nothing else to reflect. Under the windows the roses have choked in their beds. Was the gardener killed? And the postman? In the drawer of the cedar stand peeling in the verandah, a pile of damp letters one to my father to attend a meeting the previous autumn, another an invitation to a wedding. My first key opens the door. I break into quiet. The lights work. The Koran still protects the house, lying strangely wrapped in a jamawar shawl where my mother had left it on the walnut table by the fireplace. Above, If God is with you, Victory is near! the framed calligraphy ruthless behind cobwebs. I pick up the dead phone, its number exiled from its instrument, a refugee among forlorn numbers in some angry office on Exchange Road. But the receiver has caught a transmission: Rafi’s song from a film about war: Slowly, I so slowly, kept on walking, and then was severed forever from her. THIS IS ALL INDIA RADIO, AMRITSAR.

It was an act of will. I realize that now. I was always afraid of asking for things from the devil. I would probably get them. Then I stumbled onto this idea about the purity of the heart. This is a way I could get what I want. To desire one thing, that’s the idea. I knew I could do that. And I already knew what I wanted. To keep doing what I was doing, but to know that it was true. It was right for me to keep doing that, to want nothing else but that. I felt free at last. My life had become a dream. My dream. My life was the cloth of that. Days spent sharing an egg with a cat were good days. With my little red floor & white walls. & millions of men in my bed. It meant nothing. I liked alcohol. What poet didn’t. I woke up in the dreaming poem of the day & made myself a hot black cup of coffee. I would begin. Soon I would want something. A cigarette. That was good. The place I bought them was far enough, a walk, good for my body, something blue for my hand. Who did I think the poet was. A talking dog. Who felt her lips with her fingertips & wrote that down. You see the page for me has terrific dimension. I can go into the white & I do. The lines are designs for something real, how much space around the slender bars I bend and shape in the name of my world. A comma is a little fish, a dash sort of a raft. When we say capitals we mean apples. German words about the same size as God. When you want to refer to that. Its comedy. Sometimes the poem wants to come home. It has a firm back, its left hand margin, sometimes it feels just fine about that. The page is the sky. My typewriter, classic, a wispy one had no spine & so my poems floated like clouds, globs of sunlessness & I marked the world free. Sensationally flat poems I know each line went from there to there was ironic as print felt that way soothed by the cruelty of wasps and was crisper than them, just a season of flat poems. Lonely the loss of rock n roll. It was receding. My poems were flat. A woman made me ache, I was love on the page not yet I had always felt like a brick shit house. I was the poem. The incident in the afternoon the folded sheet, I was the mouth the sounds emitted from I was the pipes of god, me this structure in eternity. Enter it. The oldest dream I remember an important one was about a train in the night going to Germany & I must get on & save myself. Once in a while I say be full, and it is, be slow, oh tear holes in me as the day dies.

Little humps of sand, of water mixed with sand so thoroughly that granules of this new matter have the texture of firn, stick out smartly where the surf used to pound the shore, and beyond that a great frozen slab opens out like a cold hand, lined with the details of waves, crests, white horses of snow, a fleeting image of air in a furtive coupling of wind and spray, an alphabet of meanings receding to the horizon, repeated to infinity, an infinity of vibrations and still-born interferences. I think of a deserted Venice. I move without a shadow and enter the deep, lost in the sound of ice scrunching under my feet. But if I stop there will be a withering silence wrapped in the whisper of melting snow, of crumbling crests and friezes more delicate than soot. Here and there are cracks, as flashy as lightning, the contours of ice-floes, the blueprints of disintegration. And I imagine that I could mistake it all for one huge jigsaw puzzle, sit down and wait till water washes away the pattern, the frozen craziness of it, until I sink, slowly, to the bottom. From up there, you won’t hear me. Perhaps heaven is like this. So white, you can’t look at it, so silent, you can’t hear a word.

The sky is reflected in this - mirror, so completely that when I lie on my back the clouds seem to pass through me like sand in an hourglass and stiffening, coagulating into ribbons of snow they unfurl in long lines of print which in a moment will be quickened by a touch of sunshine. A few more turns of the body and the sea is like the roof of a white cave, beneath which I hang like a bat, with the sky underneath like a sea. And at night I stay for the night that crash and creak of ice, grinding and rumbling as it plays with the cables of ships, in a violent effort to keep things moving? On the moon’s behalf? Or some other satellite’s? To mould these snowy crests into a smile? A stealthy smile when no-one is looking? And when no-one looks I spot a whirlpool and a welter of the waves, a blizzard of shapes: shadowy headless forms, of serpents coiled into rings, of the frenzied dance of the Maenads, and Athenian magistrates.","author":"Andrzej Sosnowski","entry_meta":"(1994)","id":75},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"from Lawn of Excluded Middle","text":"When I say I believe that women have a soul and that its substance contains two carbon rings the picture in the foreground makes it difficult to find its appearance back where the corridors get lost in ritual sacrifice and hidden bleeding.

Something that can be held in the mouth, deeply, like darkness by someone blind or the empty space I place at the center of each poem to allow penetration. I’m looking out the window at other windows. Though the pane masquerades as transparent I know it is impenetrable just as too great a show of frankness gives you a mere paper draft on revelations. As if words were passports, or arrows that point to the application we might make of them without considering the difference of biography and life. Still, depth of field allows the mind to drift beyond its negative pole to sun catching on a maple leaf already red in August, already thinner, more translucent, preparing to strip off all that separates it from its smooth skeleton. Beautiful, flamboyant phrase that trails off without predicate, intending disappearance by approaching it, a toss in the air. I put a ruler in my handbag, having heard men talk about their sex. Now we have correct measurements and a stickiness between collar and neck. It is one thing to insert yourself into a mirror, but quite another to get your image out again and have your errors pass for objectivity. Vitreous. As in humor. A change in perspective is caused by the ciliary muscle, but need not be conciliatory. Still, the eye is a camera, room for everything that is to enter, like the cylinder called the satisfaction of hollow space. Only language grows such grass-green grass. Even if a woman sits at a loom, it does not mean she must weave a cosmogony or clothes to cover the emptiness underneath. It might just be a piece of cloth which, like any center of attention, absorbs the available light the way a waterfall can form a curtain of solid noise through which only time can pass. She has been taught to imagine other things, but does not explain, disdaining defense while her consciousness streams down the rapids. The light converges on what might be the hollow of desire or the incomplete self, or just lint in her pocket. Her hour will also come with the breaking of water. Because I refuse to accept the opposition of night and day I must pit other, subtler periodicities against the emptiness of being an adult. Their traces inside my body attempt precariously, like any sign, to produce understanding, but though nothing may come of that, the grass is growing. Can words play my parts and also find their own way to the house next door as rays converge and solve their differences? Or do notes follow because drawn to a conclusion? If we don’t signal our love, reason will eat our heart out before it can admit its form of mere intention, and we won’t know what has departed. All roads lead, but how does a sentence do it? Nothing seems hidden, but it goes by so fast when I should like to see it laid open to view whether the engine resembles combustion so that form becomes its own explanation. We’ve been taught to apply solar principles, but must find on our own where to look for Rome the way words rally to the blanks between them and thus augment the volume of their resonance.","author":"Rosmarie Waldrop","entry_meta":"(1993)","id":76},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The Word-Gulag","text":"They’ve opened a new gulag. The word-gulag. I go there every week, and take a shopping bag filled with fresh fruit, a bar of soap and a few tins of condensed milk. I call out a prisoner’s name at random, then wait in the visitors room with the gesturing crowd. One by one, the words file out of a little door and stand in front of us on the other side of the wire. Pale. Trembling. Haggard. Shattered. Speak. the guard barks while he patrols the corridor that divides us, clanging his keys against the grille. No one responds. The words can’t reply because their jaws are visibly broken. Nor can the visitors because, as they’ve just suddenly realised they really should have wised up to this earlier the gulag has robbed them of all their best words. Visiting time is over, the guard shouts, drawing a curtain we hadn’t noticed before. Some barely audible words burst out, but nobody could tell which side of the grille they were coming from. They were probably words of goodbye. Abdellatif Laâbi 1993, translated from the Arabic by André Naffis-Sahely Dustie-Fute When I opened my window and reached for the yoghurt cooling on the outside ledge, it had gone. All that remained was a single Scottish word bewildered by the Paris winter frost and the lights of its riverbank motorways. What can dustie-fute have to say to a night like this? How can it dangle its hyphen down into the rue Geoffrey L’Asnier where Danton stayed on the eve of revolution? How can it tame this strangeness for me or change me into the cupolas and flagstones I so desire yet still notice every time I walk among them? Does the auld alliance of words and things stand a chance among the traffics and pimps in the Publicis Saint-Germain? For it’s not as if dustie-fute were my familiar. I could easily confuse dustie-fute with elfmill which is the sound made by a worm in the timber of a house, supposed by the vulgar to be preternatural. These words are as foreign as the city they have parachuted into, dead words slipping on the sill of a living metropolis. They are extremes that touch like dangerous wires and the only hope for them, for us, is the space they inhabit, a room Cioran speaks of, veering between dilettantism and dynamite. Old Scots word, big French city and in between abysmal me, ane merchand or creamer, quha hes no certain dwelling place, quhair the dust may be dicht fra hes feete or schone. Dustie-fute, a stranger, equivalent to fairand-man, at a loss in the empty soul of his ancestors beautiful language and in the soulless city of his compeers living the 21st century now and scoffing at his medieval wares. Yet here, precisely here, is their rendez-vous and triumphantly, stuffed down his sock, an oblique sense, the dustie-fute of revelry’, the acrobat, the juggler who accompanies the toe-belled jongleur with his merchant’s comic fairground face. He reaches deep into his base Latinity, into his pede-pulverosi and French descendants pull out their own pieds poudreux. Dustie-fute remembers previous lives amid the plate glass of Les Halles. They magnify his motley, his mid-oranges, his hawker lyrics and for a second Beaubourg words graze Scottish glass then glance apart. In this revelry differences copulate, become more visible and bearable and, stranger than the words or city I inhabit, I reach for my yoghurt and find it there.","author":"David Kinloch","entry_meta":"(1992)","id":77},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"dropped on the ground - the small coin","text":"People were gathered on the square watching a man make popcorn.

I was wearing split-pants, my round chubby bottom must have stuck outside the surface of the earth like today’s hostage, for this reason the ferocious people did not have the heart to knock me over. I crawled here and there. My uncle and the monk preferred to stand at a lower place. The popcorn maker’s face and chest were smeared dark with soot, except for the whites of his eyes, making him look like the chief witness at a wedding. The whites of his eyes proved his honesty and fair dealing. Evidently there was no deception in the popcorn. Uncle tested it with his fingers, then with his nose, finally with his soft lips and then everything was clear. He returned home. Then appeared some grave omens. While I was crawling among the crowd, I had already learned to detest the monk’s cloth shoes. I attempted to climb to a higher place, after I grew up this became clearer. I moved slowly toward the popcorn maker. Showed him a small coin. On one side there were all odd numbers, on the other side all even numbers. The popcorn man grinned with puzzlement, I saw that besides the whites of his eyes, the inner edge of his lips near the gums was also white. I tossed the small coin into the air, it fell, and I pressed it in my hand. If the odd-numbered side was up, I would throw the coin into the popcorn machine, and pop it with the corn.

He knew about front lawns too, and greenhouses, and the interiors of cars. This is how our love affair would go. We would meet at a hotel, or a motel, whether expensive or cheap it wouldn’t matter. We would enter the room, lock the door, and begin to explore the furniture, fingering the curtains, running our hands along the spurious gilt frames of the pictures, over the real marble or the chipped enamel of the luxurious or tacky washroom sink, inhaling the odor of the carpets, old cigarette smoke and spilled gin and fast meaningless sex or else the rich abstract scent of the oval transparent soaps imported from England, it wouldn’t matter to us; what would matter would be our response to the furniture, and the furniture’s response to us.

This is the bar of broken survivors, the club of the shotgun, knife wound, of poison by culture. We who were taught not to stare drank our beer. The players gossiped down their cues. Someone put a quarter in the jukebox to relive despair. Richard’s wife dove to kill her. We had to keep her still, while Richard secretly bought the beauty a drink. How do I say it? In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses. I could say it in my own and the sacred mounds would come into focus, but I couldn’t take it in this dingy envelope. So I look at the stars in this strange city, frozen to the back of the sky, the only promises that ever make sense. My brother-in-law hung out with white people, went to law school with a perfect record, quit. Says you can keep your laws, your words. And practiced law on the street with his hands. He jimmied to the proverbial dream girl, the face of the moon, while the players racked a new game. He bragged to us, he told her magic words and that when she broke, became human.

You would know she could hear only what she wanted to; don’t we all? Left the drink of betrayal Richard bought her, at the bar. What was she on? We all wanted some. Put a quarter in the juke. We all take risks stepping into thin air. Our ceremonies didn’t predict this. Or we expected more. I had to tell you this, for the baby inside the girl sealed up with a lick of hope and swimming into the praise of nations. This is not a rooming house, but a dream of winter falls and the deer who portrayed the relatives of strangers. The way back is deer breath on icy windows. The next dance none of us predicted. She borrowed a chair for the stairway to heaven and stood on a table of names. And danced in the room of children without shoes. You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille. With four hungry children and a crop in the field. And then she took off her clothes. She shook loose memory, waltzed with the empty lover we’d all become. She was the myth slipped down through dreamtime. The promise of feast we all knew was coming. The deer who crossed through knots of a curse to find us. She was no slouch, and neither were we, watching. The music ended. And so does the story. I wasn’t there. But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left.","author":"Joy Harjo","entry_meta":"(1990)","id":88},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"from The Stumbling Block Its Index","text":"The Stumbling Block is a graphite font.

When the butler told him the old lady had just gone out, but that the young lady was at home, he fumbled in his fur coat and dresscoat pocket, found his card, and said, Right. But it was not right. Driving from his house in the morning to pay a visit, he thought he was compelled to it by the conventions of society which weighed heavily upon him. But now it was clear that he went to pay calls only because somewhere far away in the depths of his soul, as under a veil, there lay hidden a hope that he would see Nadya, his secret love. And he suddenly felt pitiful, sad, and not a little anxious. In his soul, it seemed to him, it was snowing, and everything was fading away. He was afraid to love Nadya, because he thought he was too old for her, his appearance unattractive, and did not believe that a young woman like her could love a man for his mind or spiritual character. Everything was dim, sharing, he felt, the same blank character. Still, there would rise at times in him something like hope, a glimpse of happiness, of things turning out all right. Then, just as quickly, it would pass away. And he would wonder what had come over him. Why should he, a retired councillor of state, educated, liberal-minded, a well-traveled man; why should he, in other words, be so anxious? Were there not other women with whom he could fall in love? Surely, it was always possible to fall in love. It was possible, moreover, to fall in love without acting out of character. There was absolutely no need for him to be anxious. To be in love, to have a young pretty wife and children of his own, was not a crime or a deception, but his right. Clearly, there was something wrong with him. He wished he were far away - But suddenly he hears from somewhere in the house the young officer’s spurs jingle and then die away. That instant marked the death of his timid love.

The man in the shop in Cambridge said he didn’t have any old pine, but when Earlene went back after thinking about it to say she was sure she had seen some, the man found it. Right under his feet, which was puzzling. Mr. Acker, hearing the story, explained. You know, he said, a lot of fiddling goes on in those places. The first time you went in, the governor was there, the second time he wasn’t, so the chap sold you some scrap and he’s four quid in pocket.

She came to me as in a shadow play, that ancient art of the south, her tiny figure fluttering into sight across my bedsheet. When her body sailed into full view I realized she sat on a stool, hands tied behind her, mouth stuffed with a gag. Next, I saw the old fashioned sailing ship, the sort one sees on Lipton tea tins with three masts and a tottering deck. Her feet were tied to the foot of a mast, then knotted to the three-legged stool. Her profile was clear now, the high cheek bones, large firm mouth and beaked nose, all familiar from the photographs of my childhood. I beckoned in my dream, but she would not speak. Then came the fat man, slowly, as if the shadow players were unwilling. Twice as large as she was. A broad brimmed hat, the cowboy kind thrust to his head, boots that came up to his knees. A whip in his right hand. A fat cigar in his mouth. A Britisher, without a doubt. He plucked it out. Her arms moved up now, over the mast, still tied. By remote control, they moved up, inch by inch. I smelt the shock of singed hair, the fiery nib. I bit my tongue. I did not weep. How could I when she sat there, utterly still. She did not cringe, she did not twitch a lip, my grandmother. The ship moved on. Water lapped against the deck in small pointy waves. The water touched her toes. She sat there holding the fire in her armpits. Finally he seemed to tire. He leant his hulk over the deck and vomited into water. The tiny men who scurried in bearing platters of peaches and pigs, turtle doves and duck eggs, knelt at the portholes and wept. They could not untie grandmother, their wrists too frail from malnutrition. They did not have metal hidden in their pockets. She just sat there, my grandmother, as the ship sailed into darkness. Her arms were still lifted high. Did the moonlight cool her face? Did the ropes slip off, a cunning resolution the puppeteers sometimes allow? Was she lifted off the ship and carried in triumph? Did Gandhi greet her? I did not ask consoling questions in my sleep. It was the stench of burnt hair that stayed with me.","author":"Meena Alexander","entry_meta":"(1988)","id":95},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The Hanoi Market","text":"It smells of sea and earth, of things dying and newly born.

Like an unpleasant aunt whom you’re supposed to love just because she is a blood relative. It was a new photograph, her latest winter portrait. A canopied wagon is waiting in the courtyard.

The exhibits, the air almost clear of dust, the reflections on the glass of the display cases. The way the attendants, two old women, sit in the corner, their grey hair permed into waves, one of them carefully sipping coffee from the cap of a thermos flask. I don’t really look at anything. Please don’t think I’m there to look. I look at nothing. Regrettable but true. Celtic axe-handle, medieval tile, picture, non-figurative statue, I ignore them all. Or do I look? Have I looked in the past? Looked too much so that all looking is superfluous? Because I can look at them now, there on the wall opposite, a whole row of living proofs: blues, copper-colours, patches, gradients, the dark-brown charges of night cavalry - tomatoes with cabbage. Simpler. I used to make it with peas. suspended by their spears, driven forward by spears, holding them, vertical, howling as they fling them. Or is it something else? Is this the same set of pictures? Do any of them match up? Mere references on a wall, quotations from an obsession? Perhaps this is enough. A picture frame on a white expanse of wall, possibly with a picture in it: it may be enough. It might be a row of broom-handles in the frame, that naïve little path leading into the background of trees. The road can take us no further: it is impassable. There is no shoe to tread it, no hoof to gallop it. Not even an aircraft some small agricultural whirlybird to flutter clumsily along its curves, cleverly sniffing its way from above. Yet how poignantly the road invites us, with its imperceptible arcing movement, sucking us, wafting us in, my eyes, the eyes behind my eyes and the eyes behind those eyes its magnetic field comprising man-made eyes along lines of force organised into arcs. Could there be a more relaxing window anywhere in the world? Such a bundle of sunlight on a sunlit-yellow floor?

Into the narrow space between building battlements, geometrical lilliputian flowerbeds, with tiny round laurel trees beside them: whenever I do this I feel I am stepping into a child’s drawing, a Book of Hours with small coloured engravings. I have to move more carefully here, to learn the scale of an existential game. Slowly, warily, ever more narrowly along the path of an enormous mini-universe no shoe can tread. Nevertheless, I must proceed and measure this alternative terrain with steps whose deeds exceed imagination. Breathe slowly and warily. The air has been calibrated into limited quantities. Whence the shadow on this domain, whence the light? Of course, it is the two chestnut trees there that are the cause, two scarlet-flowered great wild-chestnut trees that glow above me, that act as tents in a holiday mood so that the hidden otherworld down here is soaked in smoky greenish-reddish light. One must stop. One listens with slightly raised head to something almost audible. There is nothing left to do now but to leave. Leave the garden by the gate, descend the hill, with the rondella to your left of course, and to the right - to the right the quarry shed with its wire-fenced side where feral cats swarm over miscellaneous old stones.

Or else, as I glanced to the right on going into the tabac to buy two boxes of matches, or else I had gone into a tabac to buy two boxes of matches, and glancing to the right I saw a small woman, not old, not young, perched on a chair, and she was eating what I took to be a tartine, or else the remnant of a tartine. She held the bread in both hands, like a squirrel, and her feet did not touch the floor. She was a very small person, and her face was round and white. Then I asked for the matches, paid for them, and while turning to leave took a second look at the small woman. It was a small tabac, too, with only two or three tables and chairs lined up against the wall, and a mirror ran along the wall, reaching to the floor. The woman, perched on the chair, her feet not touching the floor, was half-turned toward the wall, she took a bite at her tartine, leaving behind a white streak of bread in her two clasped hands. She sat turned away from the rest of the tabac. But she was so small that her round white face hardly appeared in the mirror. She ate like a trapped animal. She did not want to be seen. She did not want to see herself, yet, turning her face away from the space of the tabac, she almost had to be seeing herself, in the mirror, and also in the mirror the inescapable tabac space in which she felt conspicuous. Or else, she was a very small woman with a round white face which nobody wanted to see, not even herself, but she had to be somewhere, in order to eat. Still, she was eating in such a way as to indicate that she wanted to live, hands clasping bread, even if living meant disappearing. All around her, all around me, in that small space, the packets of cigarettes and the boxes of matches, the people walking in the street, on their way from the day’s work, in their appropriate clothes, and the dogs going about their business, and the continuous roar of all the cars. Or else: I cannot say all around us. No link. No common root, at best a rhizome, contrived by the other bodies and the noises, in their scatteredness, connected her particularity and mine, within a surface of observation more fleeting even than the last white shred of her tartine at which I saw her now sucking, not chewing, no, but sucking. The question of her teeth had not yet arisen. Strong teeth, squirrel teeth, grow in straight jaws, but hers might be weak teeth, in such round jaws. She lacked the courage, or else the presumption, to use a good toothpaste, and this had been going on for years. Nor had she the means to visit a dentist. Or else she had once scraped and saved, had once made an appointment, but the dentist had sent her away the moment he saw her. A tartine has a strong crust. So many sacrifices, in such a life. The cheapest food, a tartine, with ham or jam, and a little butter. Even then, she had to eat the tartine in her particular way, by sucking, and in public, she had to turn her face aside and not look, she wanted to eat while being invisible, she had a passion of great force, dangerous, for the tartines of this tabac, and here the rhizome put forth another bud, because in her I saw another being who had to aim, straight-on, for the impossible. Or else: I went into the tabac after spending an afternoon with a young woman, small and beautiful, with a laugh like the silver trickle of starlight seen in the water of a well. We had walked across bridges and along corridors, we had exchanged sweat from the palms of our hands, we had sat beside one another with mirrors behind us, gazing out into the world, or gazing at each other, in the envious ancient way of Assyrians; but who, now, among the ancient Assyrians would care to wonder about the small woman with the round white face, or who else, one century or two from now, in Paris, would want to know that she existed? She might never have been touched. I saw her short legs, white and lumpy, because, the way she sat, twisting away from the world, her skirt was hitched up to her knees. Nobody had ever wanted to stroke them. With her weak teeth she had never bitten anybody. With her small and frightened mouth she had never sucked anybody. Or else nobody living one century or two from now, no ancient Assyrian either, would, unless I am mistaken, want or have wanted to be bitten, or else sucked, by the small woman with the round white face and the unstroked legs. She was not a tiny soldier in the battle against chance, so by chance she had to be a nullity. When she looked in a mirror and saw herself, she might have found it hard to believe that this was all she was: not even worth a glance, but worse a pretext for averting every glance. Round, small, white zero, with a circumference nobody would dream of stroking into place, thus not even, really, a zero. The continuous roar of traffic. The dogs going about their business. Perched on the chair, a blob of absolute anxiety. Blob and there they go, the beautiful ancient Assyrians, and others, who can be seen, who think it is they who happen, not chance, who receive existence from a knowledge that they are to be seen; and there they go, the dogs, capering and sniffing, a blob in their track is a small woman with a round white face and wet-looking hair which nobody wants to comb or pat; a blob sucking a tartine in a tabac and looking aside, or else down, she wants only not to be there where everyone else happens to be going. Or else I am mistaken, entirely mistaken, and what I see is a large and very beautiful flea. A star among the fleas. And the dogs, in holy terror, worship her? From flea to angel, the spectrum of perception bends and cracks under the buffetings of chance, as, in a changed perspective, a world of different objects comes into position. Lens-grinding Spinoza says to the small woman she does not hear, and I may not have heard correctly: Every being which is made conscious of its interior power comes to persevere the more insistently in its particular nature. Never once did anything occur to the small woman such as might have shown her that plenitude of interior power. She perseveres because she has been doomed to do so, by the dogs in the street, or else like them, by the space of the tabac, by the mirror which has finally annulled even her capacity to despair of herself. Or else: A chair in a small tabac, her twisted body insisting on it, is this a likely perch for the Celestial Globe-Hopper, the Pure Flea Spirit? Passing from Spinoza’s triangle to the cube, I put one box of matches in my coat pocket, the other in my trouser pocket, and could not say whether or not I was mistaken. Or else I had ground this lens not cruelly enough, for I felt mounting in my throat a galaxy of tears; or else I was grinding into the lens not this indelible presence but my own shadow, nicotine, idiotic.","author":"Christopher Middleton","entry_meta":"(1983)","id":106},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"abglanz / reflected gleam","text":"from the field borders flows a dried-out baking quiet of thistledown and crumbs of soil. a grey velvet, which scratches on the throat and makes a fur on the tongue. the overheated, glassy air curdles under streaming strokes of shimmering. untameable thirst. earth-chilled springwater slurped in long, greedy gulps from the scoop. the burnt-down field devil inflates his nostrils and licks at the reviving moisture, which rebounds from the sky and perks up the wearily drooping turnip fields. the bare, bone hard surface deeply cracked. from long ago the noontide demon walks through the man-high corn to frighten children, knowing the locality and full of cunning. spectral cutting of rye. thrifty herb women, who draw from the holiday riot of the field weeds a yield in bridal white, hump skips loaded high from the verges. earthy stubble dance. stooked scales of sounds. long-stalked, the sheaves bounce onto the swaying wagon. wobbling dewlaps of oxen, shapeless, almost dragging the ground. the rhythmic sway of the animals bodies. the hanging threads of slobber. in dust and rumble of the threshing machine swirling up clouds of husks and awns. with the rake, the chaff swept into baskets. the grain tipped out and piling up. thumbnail test. our daily bread. this year’s harvest weighed up in the hollow of the hand. false weights are an abomination to the Lord, full measure pleases Him. piled up rows of sacks leaning against the barn walls. stacked on top of each other with the handy carrying-pole by two people. on the circle behind the mountain of cheese a robbers castle reared up out of bundles of straw. by Korah’s band secretly scaled and conquered without a fight. autumnal sign of a childhood. the day falls into step and props itself up on columns of flies. tripping, ebbing tail-lashes and arm movements. the draught animals unyoked and unharnessed. free time, to drink one’s fill at the pipe. grass talk aslant, wind-winged, intoxicating evening cool from the feed wagon. landsberger mixture, three in one between the rungs, laid on with the fork. from the open half-door the clattering of milk-cans, jingling cow-chains. the centrifuge hums. milk picking-up time, the people with their jugs make a queue before the women ladling out. your grandfather drowned in buttermilk, I hear the farm women mock. o blue lyre milk. the tuning of the flowing-away sunset in the highest tones, far as a cricket. the lights going up for the end of day. a single shrill burst from the meadows and field verges. the world spirit rears up and beats his breast, the lavender coloured current draws stealthily back, soft as cat’s paws. the calligraphic house wall, from which the weathered warmth reverberates, broad-sided, breathes like an exhausted animal resting in the shade, gathering new strength. the crumbs of clay trickle down from the daub filling between beams. earth to earth. visible face and pushing into position go in the reflected light towards the night. holy sack of straw, the earth floor in the lower room. suited to its station. dark lantern, superstitious moon, mate and drinking partner. to-wit to-woo.","author":"Wulf Kirsten","entry_meta":"(1982)","id":107},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Honey","text":"My father died at the age of eighty.

Anyway, I did the blanket and lots of hairs came off. There were long brown ones, my own; long red henna’d ones, my wife’s; and some long blonde hairs that belonged to an Irish girl called Ann. They all got twisted together. I should have changed the water before doing the normal weekly load, but I didn’t. When I took the rest of the stuff out I realised I’d left a paper handkerchief in one of the pockets. It got shredded up by the paddle and everything was covered in bits. I was also doing some washing for my lodger and I didn’t think she’d appreciate this. Shelagh, I said, they’ve come out clean but you’ll have to spend some time tomorrow picking these bits off your nice white blouse. Let’s have a look, she said.

I was in his house. His wife carried a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man’s legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes, say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck themselves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground. Carolyn Forché 1981 Meeting Ezra Pound I don’t know what came first, poets or festivals. Nevertheless, it was a festival that caused me to meet Ezra Pound. They seated him in a chair on a square in Spoleto and pushed me towards him. He took the hand I extended and looked with those light blue eyes right through my head, way off into the distance. That was all. He didn’t move after that. He didn’t let go of my hand, he forgot the eyes. It was a lasting grip, like a gesture of a statue. His hand was icy and stony. It was impossible to get away. I said something. The sparrows chirruped. A spider was crawling on the wall, tasting the stone with its forelegs. A spider understanding the language of a stone. A freight train was passing through the tunnel of my head. A flagman in blue overalls waved gloomily from the last car. It is interesting how long it takes for a freight train like that to pass by. Then they parted us. My hand was cold too, as if I’d touched the Milky Way. So that a freight train without a schedule exists. So that a spider on a stone exists. So that a hand alone and a hand per se exists. So that a meeting without meeting exists and a person without a person. So that a tunnel exists a whole network of tunnels, empty and dark, interconnecting the living matter which is called poetry at festivals. So that I may have met Ezra Pound, only I sort of did not exist in that moment.","author":"Miroslav Holub","entry_meta":"(1980)","id":110},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Goodtime Jesus","text":"Jesus got up one day a little later than usual.

When the old man heard of it he went there and gathered up the bones. Thereafter, wherever the old man ventured, he led a dark hunting horse which bore the bones of his son on its back. And the old man said to whomever he saw, You see how it is that now my son consists in his bones, that his bones are polished and so gleam like glass in the light of the sun and moon, that he is very beautiful. There was a boy who drowned in the river, near the grove of thirty-two bois d’arc trees. The light of the moon lay like a path on the water, and a glitter of low brilliance shone in it. The boy looked at it and was enchanted. He began to sing a song that he had never heard before; only then, once, did he hear it in his heart, and it was borne like a cloud of down upon his voice. His voice entered into the bright track of the moon, and he followed after it. For a time he made his way along the path of the moon, singing. He paddled with his arms and legs and felt his body rocking down into the swirling water. His vision ran along the path of light and reached across the wide night and took hold of the moon. And across the river, where the path led into the shadows of the bank, a black dog emerged from the river, shivering and shaking the water from its hair. All night it stood in the waves of grass and howled the full moon down. On the night before a flood, the terrapins move to high ground. How is it that they know? Once there was a boy who took up a terrapin in his hands and looked at it for a long time, as hard as he could look. He succeeded in memorizing the terrapin’s face, but he failed to see how it was that the terrapin knew anything at all. There was a man who had got possession of a powerful medicine. And by means of this medicine he made a woman out of sumac leaves and lived with her for a time. Her eyes flashed, and her skin shone like pipestone. But the man abused her, and so his medicine failed. The woman was caught up in a whirlwind and blown apart. Then nothing was left of her but a thousand withered leaves scattered in the plain. A young girl awoke one night and looked out into the moonlit meadow. There appeared to be a tree; but it was only an appearance; there was a shape made of smoke; but it was only an appearance; there was a tree. One night there appeared a child in the camp. No one had ever seen it before. It was not bad-looking, and it spoke a language that was pleasant to hear, though none could understand it. The wonderful thing was that the child was perfectly unafraid, as if it were at home among its own people. The child got on well enough, but the next morning it was gone, as suddenly as it had appeared. Everyone was troubled. But then it came to be understood that the child never was, and everyone felt better. After all, said an old man, How can we believe in the child? It gave us not one word of sense to hold on to. What we saw, if indeed we saw anything at all, must have been a dog from a neighboring camp, or a bear that wandered down from the high country. There was a man who killed a buffalo bull to no purpose, only he wanted its blood on his hands. It was a great, old, noble beast, and it was a long time blowing its life away. On the edge of the night the people gathered themselves up in their grief and shame. Away in the west they could see the hump and the spine of the huge beast which lay dying along the edge of the world. They could see its bright blood run into the sky, where it dried, darkening, and was at last flecked with flakes of light. There was a woman whose hair was long and heavy and black and beautiful. She drew it about her like a shawl and so divided herself from the world that not even Age could find her. Now and then she steals into the men’s societies and fits her voice into their holiest songs. And always, just there, is a shadow which the firelight cannot cleave.","author":"Scott Momaday","entry_meta":"(1976)","id":118},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Portrait of A.

After his death I learned what little there is, born Buncrana Inishowen Donegal, 1904; name of father Samuel; mother’s name Mary McGrory. She died in his birth. He was sent to England, to be raised by an uncle, a farmer, who didn’t want him. He worked. If he had any schooling it didn’t show. He wrote his name in a child’s scrawl, claimed poor eyesight to avoid reading, refused eyeglasses. My mother said when she met him he was carrying a suitcase with two shirts in it. Nothing else. He said he was born in Northumberland, to have come from there, that his father’s name was William. Maybe he knew, or had never been told. Or maybe the clerks merely tied up loose ends and matched two sets of papers to give me a life not his. He never would talk of it. She remembered he would stare at a knife and fork, not knowing which hand to take them in, when he came into the house he said goodnight in greeting. She married him, his silence and his violence and his gentleness. We went from farm to farm, a hired man living in a tied house, the furniture piled in a cattle truck. His fingers were frostbitten, white and stiff, I have spoken of them. Quarrelsome, proud and private, he could agree with no one. Locked out of one farm, he nailed every door and window to its jamb. Sacked from another, he fired the stackyard. He had no friends, confided in no one, his rhythm long quietness broken by bursts of sustained anger. It was his solitude I loved; his stern face coming in from the frost, a stolen chicken under his coat. And his shy grin, his slow walk through the fields, the dog circling him. He did nothing but work, so long as there was light to do it by, till the light went out of him, whatever it meant. I laboured to write this for him. The stone carries his name and dates and the middle name that may not be his, and a wild rose cut into its corner. There is another space, blank, waiting for the mallet. The chalk folds around him, waits for the sea’s coming. The silence has gone into itself. If the grave is that deep it is deeper. I walk away from it, valuing my life, the woman I married, the children she brought out of herself crying. Months later I discovered I was happy that my life meant it could not be given up. Whatever these are, whether they are poems or not, they are to celebrate, the drip of water building a tower of itself from the minerals it has gathered. The dead lie with bitterness in their mouths.

I am happy that he chooses sometimes to be with me.

Knowing we have made peace, he and I, I want him to make peace with them. They tower below us, like wheat.","author":"Ken Smith","entry_meta":"(1973)","id":124},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Chimes of Silence","text":"At first there is a peep-hole on the living. It sneaks into the yard of lunatics, lifers, violent and violated nerves, cripples, tuberculars, victims of power sadism safely hidden from questions. A little square hole cut in the door, enough for a gaoler’s fist to pass through and manipulate the bolt from either side. Enough also for me to casually, oh so casually steal a quick look at the rare flash of a hand, a face, a gesture; more often a blur of khaki, the square planted rear of the guard on the other side. Until one day, a noise of hammering. All morning an assault of blows multiplied and magnified by the unique echoing powers of my crypt. When it thunders, my skull is the anvil of gods. By noon that breach is sealed. Only the sky is now open, a sky the size of a napkin trapped by tall spikes and broken bottles, but a sky. Vultures perch on a roof just visible from another yard. And crows. Egrets overfly my crypt and bats swarm at sunset. Albino bats, sickly pale, emitting radio pips to prowl the echo chamber. But the world is dead, suddenly. For an eternity after ceasing the hammers sustain their vehemence. Even the sky retracts, dead. Buried alive? No. Only something men read of. Buoys and landmarks vanish. Slowly, remorselessly, reality dissolves and certitude betrays the mind. Days weeks months, then as suddenly as that first death, a new sound, a procession. Feet approach, dragging to the clank of chains. And now another breach that has long remained indifferent, blank, a floodhole cut in the base of the wall, this emptiness slowly, gracelessly, begins to frame manacled feet. Nothing has ever passed so close, so ponderously across the floodhole of the Wailing Wall. I named it that, because it overlooks the yard where a voice cried out in agony all of one night and died at dawn, unattended. It is the yard from which hymns and prayers rise with a constancy matched only by the vigil of crows and vultures. And now, feet. Bare except for two pairs of boots which consciously walk deadweight to match the pace of manacles on the others. Towards noon the same procession passes the other way. Some days later the proession again goes by and I count. Eleven. The third day of this procession wakes into the longest dawn that ever was born and died of silence, a silence replete and awesome. My counting stops brusquely at six. No more. In that instant the ritual is laid bare, the silence, the furtive conspiracy of dawn, the muffled secrets hammer louder than manacles in my head, all all is bared in one paralysing understanding. Five men are walking the other way, five men walking even more slowly, wearily, with the weight of the world on each foot, on each step towards eternity. I hear them pause at every scrap of life, at every beat of the silence, at every mote in the sun, those five for whom the world is about to die. Sounds. Sounds acquire a fourth dimension in a living crypt. A definition which, as in the case of thunder becomes physically unbearable. In the case of the awaited but unheard, psychically punishing. Pips from albino bats pock the babble of evensong moslem and christian, pagan and unclassifiable. My crypt they turn into a cauldron, an inverted bell of faiths whose sonorities are gathered, stirred, skimmed, sieved in the warp and weft of sooty mildew on walls, of green velvet fungus woven by the rain’s cunning fingers. From beyond the Wall of Mists the perverse piety of women, that inhuman patience to which they are born drifts across to lash the anguish from the Wall of Purgatory. A clap of wings a white-and-ochre bolt, a wood-pigeon diving and crossing, a restless shuttle threading sun-patches through this darkest of looms. Beyond and above the outside wall, a rustle of leaves a boy’s face. A guileless hunter unmasks, in innocence an evil labyrinth. I shall know his voice when children’s songs invade the cauldron of sounds at twilight, this pulse intrusion in the home of death. The sun is rising behind him. His head dissolves in the pool, a shuttle sinking in a fiery loom.","author":"Wole Soyinka","entry_meta":"(1972)","id":125},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"from Mercian Hymns","text":"King of the perennial holly-groves, the riven sandstone, overlord of the M5: architect of the historic rampart and ditch, the citadel at Tamworth, the summer hermitage in Holy Cross: guardian of the Welsh Bridge and the Iron Bridge: contractor to the desirable new estates: saltmaster: moneychanger: commissioner for oaths: martyrologist: the friend of Charlemagne.

Exile or pilgrim set me once more upon that ground: my rich and desolate childhood. Dreamy, smug-faced, sick on outings I who was taken to be a king of some kind, a prodigy, a maimed one. Brooding on the eightieth letter of Fors Clavigera, I speak this in memory of my grandmother, whose childhood and prime womanhood were spent in the nailer’s darg. The nailshop stood back of the cottage, by the fold. It reeked stale mineral sweat. Sparks had furred its low roof. In dawn-light the troughed water floated a damson-bloom of dust – not to be shaken by posthumous clamour. It is one thing to celebrate the quick forge’, another to cradle a face hare-lipped by the searing wire. Brooding on the eightieth letter of Fors Clavigera, I speak this in memory of my grandmother, whose childhood and prime womanhood were spent in the nailer’s darg. Now when King Offa was alive and dead’, they were all there, the funereal gleemen: papal legate and rural dean; Merovingian car-dealers, Welsh mercenaries; a shuffle of house-carls. He was defunct. They were perfunctory. The ceremony stood acclaimed. The mob received memorial vouchers and signs. After that shadowy, thrashing midsummer hail-storm, Earth lay for a while, the ghost-bride of livid Thor, butcher of strawberries, and the shire-tree dripped red in the arena of its uprooting. Processes of generation; deeds of settlement. The urge to marry well; wit to invest in the properties of healing-springs. Our children and our children’s children, o my masters. Tracks of ancient occupation. Frail ironworks rusting in the thorn-thicket. Hearthstones; charred lullabies. A solitary axe-blow that is the echo of a lost sound.

It stood empty for a few days, empty, until I filled it with books, all the bound ones, the heavy ones. In doing so, I had let in the nether world. Something came from underneath, rose slowly and inexorably like a massive column of mercury. One was not allowed to turn one’s head away. The dark volumes, closed faces. They are like Algerians who stood at the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint and waited for the Volkspolizei to examine their passports. My own passport has long since lain among the glass cages. And the haze which was in Berlin in those days is also inside the bookcase. In there lies an old despair that tastes of Passchendaele and the Versailles Peace, that tastes even older. The dark heavy tomes I come back to them they are in reality a kind of passport and they are so thick because they have collected so many stamps through the centuries. Evidently you cannot travel with enough heavy baggage, now when you set off, when you at last - All the old historians are there, they rise up there and look into our family. Nothing is heard but the lips are moving all the time behind the glass Passchendaele -. It makes you think of an aged civil service department a pure ghost-story follows, a building where portraits of long since dead men hang behind glass and one morning there was vapour on the inside of the glass. They had begun to breathe during the night. The bookcase is still more powerful. The glances straight across the border. A gleaming membrane, the gleaming membrane on a dark river which the room must see itself in. And one is not allowed to turn one’s head away. Tomas Tranströmer 1970, translated from the Swedish by Robert Fulton For John Clare Kind of empty in the way it sees everything, the earth gets to its feet and salutes the sky. More of a success at it this time than most others it is. The feeling that the sky might be in the back of someone’s mind. Then there is no telling how many there are. They grace everything bush and tree to take the roisterer’s mind off his caroling so it’s like a smooth switch back. To what was aired in their previous conniption fit. There is so much to be seen everywhere that it’s like not getting used to it, only there is so much it never feels new, never any different. You are standing looking at that building and you cannot take it all in, certain details are already hazy and the mind boggles. What will it all be like in five years time when you try to remember? Will there have been boards in between the grass part and the edge of the street? As long as that couple is stopping to look in that window over there we cannot go. We feel like they have to tell us we can, but they never look our way and they are already gone, gone far into the future the night of time. If we could look at a photograph of it and say there they are, they never really stopped but there they are. There is so much to be said, and on the surface of it very little gets said. There ought to be room for more things, for a spreading out, like. Being immersed in the details of rock and field and slope letting them come to you for once, and then meeting them halfway would be so much easier if they took an ingenuous pride in being in one’s blood. Alas, we perceive them if at all as those things that were meant to be put aside costumes of the supporting actors or voice trilling at the end of a narrow enclosed street. You can do nothing with them. Not even offer to pay. It is possible that finally, like coming to the end of a long, barely perceptible rise, there is mutual cohesion and interaction. The whole scene is fixed in your mind, the music all present, as though you could see each note as well as hear it. I say this because there is an uneasiness in things just now. Waiting for something to be over before you are forced to notice it. The pollarded trees scarcely bucking the wind and yet it’s keen, it makes you fall over. Clabbered sky. Seasons that pass with a rush. After all it’s their time too nothing says they aren’t to make something of it. As for Jenny Wren, she cares, hopping about on her little twig like she was tryin to tell us somethin’, but that’s just it, she couldn’t even if she wanted to dumb bird. But the others and they in some way must know too it would never occur to them to want to, even if they could take the first step of the terrible journey toward feeling somebody should act, that ends in utter confusion and hopelessness, east of the sun and west of the moon.

It rose direct and thick as horse-chestnut tree trunks that do not spread out upon the ground even a little, a shaft of white drink narrowing at the cream and rounded off in a thick-lipped grin. Empty and unrinsed, a diluted milk ghost entrapped and dulled light and vision. Then things got a little worse: squared, high-shouldered and rounded off in the wrong places, a milk replica of a handmade Danish wooden milk bat. But that was only the beginning. Things got worse than that. Milk came in waxed paper that swelled and spilled and oozed flat pieces of milk. It had a little lid that didn’t close properly or resisted when pulled so that when it did give way milk jumped out. Things are getting better now. Milk is bigger half-a-gallon, at least in thin milky plastic with a handle, a jug founded on an oblong. Pick it up and the milk moves, rising enthusiastically in the neck as it shifts its center of weight. Heavy as a breast, but lighter, shaping itself without much changing shape: like bringing home the milk in a bandana, a neckerchief or a scarf, strong as canvas water wings whose strength was only felt dragged under water. On the highway this morning at the go-round, about where you leave New Hampshire, there had been an accident. Milk was sloshed on the gray-blue-black so much like a sheet of early winter ice you drove over it slowly, no matter what the temperature of the weather that eddied in through the shatterproof glass gills.

And the sand settled into itself, just as they thought it would. After the sand had settled, they tried it out to see if it could be walked on. It could. When they walked they sank in a little, but not enough to worry about. And they saw that they left marks in the sand. Every step they took left marks in the sand. They called them footprints. Now it was easier to see where they had walked. That was good. And they hadn’t invented wind and rain, so the footprints stayed where they were. That way others could follow them. If any others should want to. And that would be good. So on the very first day they made a lot of footprints in the sand. The whole first day they walked around and made footprints in the sand. When they really had made a lot of footprints in the sand, they sat down to rest and to enjoy the results of their efforts. They looked over the endless expanse and described it to each other. And when they were through describing it to each other and had no more to say to each other, either about the sand or about the many footprints they had made in the endless expanse, they saw that something was missing. And one of them said, I go in and out of this desert whenever I want On the second day they invented light. And the light spread by itself, as they had thought it would. When the light was through spreading and there was light everywhere, they saw that they could see the sand. And they immediately began to describe what they saw. Yellow and brown, they said. And green and blue and red, they said. And black and white, they said. And gray, they said. And they said it a lot of times. Finally they really felt that they were all seeing the same thing. And that was good. A little later they saw that they could also see each other. We can see each other, they said. Just like that. And because they had said it just like that, they felt that they were all seeing the same thing. And that was good. In the middle of the day, when the light was very strong, they realized the light was very strong, and they closed their eyes and sat down in the sand to rest and to keep from getting lost. They had never imagined that the light would be so strong. It’s taken over, they said. And while they sat there in the sand with their eyes closed, they really did suffer in the heat of all the light they had invented. They hadn’t invented wind and rain, remember. So there was no coolness at all. Let’s look away from it all for a moment, one of them said. So they did. And they really felt that they were all seeing the same thing. I can visualize the light, they said. That was how they suddenly understood that they had loved each other all along. On the third day they invented water. If they hadn’t, the water might have appeared by itself. It looks like it appeared by itself, they said. And they tried it out, to see if it could be walked on. It couldn’t. They kept falling through. And when they went back to the sand their feet were wet, and the sand stuck to them. So they sat down and brushed the sand from their feet. At first it was hard because the sand was wet. Little by little it got easier because the sand dried. So they talked together about the sand and the water and their effects on each other. And they realized that they had felt the sand back on the first day. It had vanished between their fingers. So they felt the water. It vanished between their fingers. Finally they felt the light. It was as if our fingers were vanishing, they said. And they felt that now they had proof of their love.","author":"Inger Christensen","entry_meta":"(1969)","id":130},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"A Case","text":"They call me that we have a case at the hospital. It is a fine night, not late, only a little after eleven. When I arrive, they tell me, Mr H— is going to operate. The patient is in the first bed on the left in the men’s ward. I go in. It is dark but some light comes from a wall fixture above the bed. He is a man in early life. I begin to ask the usual questions. I explain that I will give the anaesthetic for the operation. He says, My name is Pisgah. I nod and go on with my questions and examination. He appears tired and in some distress. The exact nature of his condition is still in doubt. It is true, when he tells me his name, I have a momentary surprise, which I suppress. The name is that of the mountain mentioned in the Bible from which Moses is said to have viewed the Promised Land. As a child, the name had intrigued me. It also occurs in a hymn, as if it were a man’s name, Pisgah’s Mount. I had often thought, singing the verse: who was Pisgah? I had used the name later, rather at random, for a person who existed in a story I was writing. It was a story upon which I had exerted myself and then, in one sense, abandoned. Pisgah, in fact, was the person in that story with whom I was most concerned. I had written two extended versions, and others more fragmentary, without being able to bring them to any satisfaction. That I had not finished those pieces did not mean that I had abandoned the work. To abandon a piece of writing is one thing. To abandon a work, is another. A particular piece of writing is a means, for a writer, which may not always finally serve the work. Thus, I write this, which also serves, for the moment. I give the anaesthetic while my friend Mr H— does the surgery. The details of the case are of no consequence. It goes well. Towards the end, when my attention is not too pressed with technical details, I have the chance to look more closely at Pisgah’s face. It is the face of a man asleep. As he sleeps, he is remote, both from himself and from us. Yet he sleeps by my will. I check his pulse, his blood pressure, his colour, his muscle tone, and gently assist each breath. In the story I had often had the experience that Pisgah was difficult to lay hold upon. His character seemed to change. Even the details of what he did or said. I had wanted to discover who exactly he was. So that I could, in some way, come to terms with him, to finish the story. Now, suddenly, I felt him alive against my hand. And that life dependent upon my attention. If my attention should fail, I might lose him for ever. I speak occasionally with Mr H—. Sometimes about the details of what he is doing. Sometimes about other things entirely. Neither of us speaks of the man with whom, in our several ways, we are involved. Later, before leaving the hospital, I make a last routine visit to Pisgah’s bed. He is now partly awake and responds to a touch on the face or a simple question. I look again into that face, somewhat firmer now, and occasionally tightened by the first twinges of pain from the incision. Who are you? I ask. He smiles faintly, out of his half sleep, as if amused that after all this time I should not know.","author":"Gael Turnbull","entry_meta":"(1968)","id":131},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"An Old-fashioned Traveller on the Trade Routes","text":"I was sitting upstairs in a bus, cursing the waste of time, and pouring my life away on one of those insane journeys across London while gradually the wavering motion of this precarious glass salon, that flung us about softly like trusses of wheat or Judo Lords, began its medicinal work inside the magnetic landscape of London. The bus, with its transparent decks of people, trembled. And was as uniquely ceremonious in propelling itself as an eminent Jellyfish with an iron will, by expulsions, valves, hisses, steams, and emotional respirations. A militant, elementary, caparisoned Jellyfish, of the feminine sex, systematically eating and drinking the sea. I began to feel as battered as though I had been making love all night. My limbs distilled the same interesting wide-awake weariness.

They are hard to catch but I, I catch them quickly in my arms and eat them up. What is that big soft monster, like a yellow cloud, stifling and warm? What is it doing? It pats my back. Out, claw.

Bridges meant building, meant the creak of planks, the delicate balance where wood is articulate, where men move as one, where the water is conquered. Where prayer is most painful, she sought for an image. Others learnt light, air, steps, birds the dove as a pretext or omen. All insubstantial for her. She needed the passion, the building, something to cleave and connect. Not standing there, letting the night drown in the water, watching the dear shadows that hold off the mountain. For her, the poise before the moment’s abandon, all the reprisals of pain. Pope, people, kings, confessors came to her. Proud professions passed over her bridges.

I know where it stands, on the mantelpiece in the still surgery. The chime falls back into the house, and beyond it, without end. Peace. I sense the simple nakedness of these tiers of sleeping men and women beneath whose windows I pass. I imagine it in its own setting, a mean bathroom in a house no longer new, a bathroom with plank panelling, painted a peculiar shade of green by an amateur, and badly preserved. It is full of steam, so much as to obscure the yellow light and hide the high, patched ceiling. In this dream, standing quiet, the private image of the householder or his wife, damp and clean. I see this as it might be floating in the dark, as if the twinkling point of a distant street-lamp had blown in closer, swelling and softening to a foggy oval. I can call up a series of such glimpses that need have no end, for they are all the bodies of strangers. Some are deformed or diseased, some are ashamed, but the peace of humility and weakness is there in them all. I have often felt myself to be vicious, in living so much by the eye, yet among so many people. I can be afraid that the egg of light through which I see these bodies might present itself as a keyhole. Yet I can find no sadism in the way I see them now. They are warmfleshed, yet their shapes have the minuscule, remote morality of some mediaeval woodcut of the Expulsion, an eternally startled Adam, a permanently bemused Eve. I see them as homunculi, moving privately each in a softly lit fruit in a nocturnal tree. I can consider without scorn or envy the well-found bedrooms I pass, walnut and rose-pink, altars of tidy, dark-haired women, bare-backed, wifely. Even in these I can see order. I come quite often now upon a sort of ecstasy, a rag of light blowing among the things I know, making me feel I am not the one for whom it was intended, that I have inadvertently been looking through another’s eyes and have seen what I cannot receive. I want to believe I live in a single world. That is why I am keeping my eyes at home while I can. The light keeps on separating the world like a table knife: it sweeps across what I see and suggests what I do not. The imaginary comes to me with as much force as the real, the remembered with as much force as the immediate. The countries on the map divide and pile up like ice-floes: what is strange is that I feel no stress, no grating discomfort among the confusion, no loss; only a belief that I should not be here. I see the iron fences and the shallow ditches of the countryside the mild wind has travelled over. I cannot enter that countryside; nor can I escape it. I cannot join together the mild wind and the shallow ditches, I cannot lay the light across the world and then watch it slide away. Each thought is at once translucent and icily capricious.

I walk through the streets of Buenos Aires and stop for a moment, perhaps mechanically now, to look at the arch of an entrance hall and the grillwork on the gate; I know of Borges from the mail and see his name on a list of professors or in a biographical dictionary. I like hourglasses, maps, eighteenth-century typography, the taste of coffee and the prose of Stevenson; he shares these preferences, but in a vain way that turns them into the attributes of an actor. It would be an exaggeration to say that ours is a hostile relationship; I live, let myself go on living, so that Borges may contrive his literature, and this literature justifies me. It is no effort for me to confess that he has achieved some valid pages, but those pages cannot save me, perhaps because what is good belongs to no one, not even to him, but rather to the language and to tradition. Besides, I am destined to perish, definitively, and only some instant of myself can survive in him. Little by little, I am giving over everything to him, though I am quite aware of his perverse custom of falsifying and magnifying things. Spinoza knew that all things long to persist in their being; the stone eternally wants to be a stone and the tiger a tiger. I shall remain in Borges, not in myself if it is true that I am someone, but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others or in the laborious strumming of a guitar. Years ago I tried to free myself from him and went from the mythologies of the outskirts to the games with time and infinity, but those games belong to Borges now and I shall have to imagine other things.

And there haven’t always been the heirs and heiresses ready to squander their sumptuously shoddy goods that came always side-by-side with the rattle of pesos and milreis. Or maybe the sarabande of the newly arrived tells us of passings on to other regions, surely we here are perfectly sheltered and out of the line of fire. It is almost as though life could not be ignited here except by lightning; as though it feeds only on such inert things as it can safely accumulate; as though it quickly cankers in such deserted zones. Del salon en angulo oscuro silenciosa y cubierta de polvo veiase el arpa - Oh, yes, the museum would be impressive if one were able to uncover this ex-paradise of Victoriana. And no one was ever seen again on the seashell-inlayed terrace, supported by the giant Neptune now scraped clean after the Lion of Callao lost the election, and died; but there, by the outrageous bay window, frescoed in pears, apples and the serpents of the earthly paradise, the good-hearted Señora Paquita thought, in vain, to carry out her serene old age, comforted by her wily needles and the smile of posterity. But one day the husbands of the daughters arrived Brazilian sons-in-law, and, the mask having been ripped away, carried these good things off. Of the duenna, and the others, not a word more was ever heard one of the descendants came back later and performed miracles, it is said. By then, however, it was, more or less, the time of the Tripolitan hymns. And these objects, these houses, stayed inside the living circle so long as it lasted. For few felt from the start that the cold was actually coming; and among these, perhaps, was my father who, even during the hottest days of August, supper out on the terrace over carried on amidst moths and more persistent insects, and after having thrown a wool shawl around his shoulders, would repeat, always in French for who knows what reason, il fait bien froid, bien froid’; then he would go off immediately into his room and lie down on the bed and smoke his 7 centime Cavour.","author":"Eugenio Montale","entry_meta":"(1956)","id":141},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"A Supermarket in California","text":"What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.

Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! and you, García Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons? I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys. I heard you asking questions of each, Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel? I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective. We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier. Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight? I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd. Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we’ll both be lonely. Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?

Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change? I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love. Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just like a pile of leaves. However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they’re missing? Uh huh. My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I am curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.

For that one simple column, which is utterly useless and meaningless to our modern lives, for that simple little column of ivory painted by your tender hands like autumn leaves I would have given the ten most beautiful years of my life, ten years of love and faith, each year equally useless and meaningless. Next to the small column I also saw, young Tutankhamun, yesterday afternoon I also saw it was one of those clear afternoons of your beloved Egypt I also saw your heart enclosed in a golden chest. For that small heart of dust, for that small heart kept in a gold, enamel box, I would have given my young, warm, and still pure heart. Because yesterday afternoon, my King full of Death, my heart beat full of life for you, and my life embraced your death and seemed to melt into it. The hard death that sticks to your bones melted under the heat of my breath and the blood of my dream, and from so much mixing of love and death I’m still intoxicated from so much dying and loving. Yesterday afternoon, an Egyptian afternoon speckled with white ibises, I loved your impossible eyes through the glass. And in some other distant Egyptian afternoon not unlike this one the light broken up by birds your eyes were immense, two long slits stretching to your trembling temples. A long time ago on an afternoon like this one your eyes lay down on the earth, and they opened on it like your country’s two mysterious lotuses. They were crimson eyes refreshed by twilights and high rivers in the month of September. Your eyes were the owners of a kingdom that boasted cities in full bloom, giant stones that had already been there for millions of years, lands sown to the horizon, armies that conquered territories extending beyond the sandy wastelands of the Nubian desert, and those renowned archers and intrepid charioteers who have remained in profile forever, as still as hieroglyphics and monoliths. Everything fit in your eyes, tender, most powerful King. Everything was destined for you before you had time to gaze on it. And you certainly had no time. Now your eyes are shut and there is a gray dust on your eyelids. They have nothing now but this gray dust, this ash of long-consumed dreams, and now, between your eyes and mine, there is an impenetrable glass. For those eyes of yours, which I couldn’t half-open with my kisses, I would give my own two eyes to whoever wants them, my own two eyes, so avid for landscapes, and like two thieves that steal from your sky, like masters of the world’s sun. I would give away my living eyes just to feel your gaze come to me through three thousand nine hundred years, to feel it upon me, to feel it come, vaguely terrifying, bearing the pale halo of Isis. Young King Tutankhamun, dead at nineteen years of age, let me tell you these absurd words that perhaps no one ever told you, let me tell them to you in the solitude of my hotel room, in the frigidity of walls shared with strangers, walls colder than those of the tomb you didn’t want to share with anyone. I tell them to you, adolescent King, you who were left in the stillness of your youthful profile, left in your crystalline grace, left in the gesture that prohibited the sacrifice of innocent doves in the temple of the terrible Ammon-Ra. This is how I will go on seeing you when I am faraway, standing tall before suspicious priests and circled by a flurry of white wings taking flight. I will have nothing of you, nothing but this dream, because everything that is you is now reserved, prohibited, and infinitely impossible. For hundreds of years your gods held a vigil for you, hanging to the last hair on your head. I think your hair must have been straight like the rain that falls in the night. For your hair and your doves and your nineteen years so close to death, I would have been what I will never be, a fragment of love. But you didn’t wait for me. You walked along the edge of a crescent moon. You left me and went to the kingdom of the dead the way a child goes to a park, followed by your shimmering gazelles and your ivory carriage full of toys that still entertained you. If the crowds of sensible people wouldn’t have become indignant, I would have kissed your toys one by one, your heavy gold and silver toys, your strange exotic toys that children of today, who box and play soccer, would never know how to use. If the crowds of sensible people wouldn’t have become scandalized, I would have taken you out of your sarcophagus, which itself was inside three wooden sarcophagi, which were themselves inside a great granite sarcophagus. I would have lifted you out of the sinister depths, the sinister depths in which you grow more dead, more dead before my emboldened heart, which beats for you alone. For you alone, Sweetest of All Kings, my heart beats on this clear Egyptian afternoon on the Nile’s luminous arm. If the crowds of sensible people wouldn’t have become furious, I would have taken you out of your five different sarcophagi, I would have loosed you from the bindings that press too heavily on your indelible body and I would have gently wrapped you in my silk shawl. I would have held you to my chest like a sick little boy and I would have sung to you the most beautiful, the most tender, of my tropical songs. I would have sung to you, sweet King, the shortest of all my poems.","author":"Loynaz","entry_meta":"(1953)","id":145},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The Clerk’s Vision","text":"And to fill all these white pages that are left for me with the same monotonous question, at what hour do the hours end? And the anterooms, the memorials, the intrigues, the negotiations with the Janitor, the Rotating Chairman, the Secretary, the Associate, the Delegate. To glimpse the Influential from afar and to send my card each year to remind who? that in some corner, devoted, steady, plodding, although not very sure of my existence, I too await the coming of my hour, I too exist. No. I quit. Yes, I know, I could settle down in an idea, in a custom, in an obsession. Or stretch out on the coals of a pain or some hope and wait there, not making much noise. Of course it’s not so bad: I eat, drink, sleep, make love, observe the marked holidays and go to the beach in summer. People like me and I like them. I take my condition lightly: sickness, insomnia, nightmares, social gatherings, the idea of death, the little worm that burrows into the heart or the liver the little worm that leaves its eggs in the brain and at night pierces the deepest sleep, the future at the expense of today the today that never comes on time, that always loses its bets. No. I renounce my ration card, my I.D., my birth certificate, voter’s registration, passport, code number, countersign, credentials, safe conduct pass, insignia, tattoo, brand. The world stretches out before me, the vast world of the big, the little, and the medium. Universe of kings and presidents and jailors, of mandarins and pariahs and liberators and liberated, of judges and witnesses and the condemned: stars of the first, second, third and nth magnitudes, planets, comets, bodies errant and eccentric or routine and domesticated by the laws of gravity, the subtle laws of falling, all keeping step, all turning slowly or rapidly around a void. Where they claim the central sun lies, the solar being, the hot beam made out of every human gaze, there is nothing but a hole and less than a hole: the eye of a dead fish, the giddy cavity of the eye that falls into itself and looks at itself without seeing. There is nothing with which to fill the hollow center of the whirlwind. The springs are smashed, the foundations collapsed, the visible or invisible bonds that joined one star to another, one body to another, one man to another, are nothing but a tangle of wires and thorns, a jungle of claws and teeth that twist us and chew us and spit us out and chew us again. No one hangs himself by the rope of a physical law. The equations fall tirelessly into themselves. And in regard to the present matter, if the present matters: I do not belong to the masters. I don’t wash my hands of it, but I am not a judge, nor a witness for the prosecution, nor an executioner. I do not torture, interrogate, or suffer interrogation. I do not loudly plead for leniency, nor wish to save myself or anyone else. And for all that I don’t do and for all that they do to us, I neither ask forgiveness nor forgive. Their piety is as abject as their justice. Am I innocent? I’m guilty. Am I guilty? I’m innocent. I’m innocent when I’m guilty, guilty when I’m innocent. I’m guilty when - but that is another song. Another song? It’s all the same song. Guilty innocent, innocent guilty, the fact is I quit. I remember my loves, my conversation, my friendships. I remember it all, see it all, see them all. With melancholy, but without nostalgia. And above all, without hope. I know that it is immortal, and that, if we are anything, we are the hope of something. For me, expectation has spent itself. I quit the nevertheless, the even, the in spite of everything, the moratoriums, the excuses and forgiving. I know the mechanism of the trap of morality and the drowsiness of certain words. I have lost faith in all those constructions of stone, ideas, ciphers. I quit. I no longer defend this broken tower. And, in silence, I await the event. A light breeze, slightly chilly, will start to blow. The newspapers will talk of a cold wave. The people will shrug their shoulders and continue life as always. The first deaths will barely swell the daily count, and no one in the statistics bureau will notice that extra zero. But after a while everyone will begin to look at each other and ask: what’s happening? Because for months doors and windows are going to rattle, furniture and trees will creak. For years there will be a shivering in the bones and a chattering of teeth, chills and goose bumps. For years the chimneys, prophets, and chiefs will howl. The mist that hangs over stagnant ponds will drift into the city. And at noon beneath the equivocal sun, the breeze will drag the smell of dry blood from a slaughterhouse abandoned even by flies. No use going out or staying at home. No use erecting walls against the impalpable. A mouth will extinguish all the fires, a doubt will root up all the decisions. It will be everywhere without being anywhere. It will blur all the mirrors. Penetrating walls and convictions, vestments and well-tempered souls, it will install itself in the marrow of everyone. Whistling between body and body, crouching between soul and soul. And all the wounds will open because, with expert and delicate, although somewhat cold, hands, it will irritate sores and pimples, will burst pustules and swellings and dig into the old, badly healed wounds. Oh fountain of blood, forever inexhaustible. Life will be a knife, a gray and agile and cutting and exact and arbitrary blade that falls and slashes and divides. To crack, to claw, to quarter, the verbs that move with giant steps against us! It is not the sword that shines in the confusion of what will be. It is not the saber, but fear and the whip. I speak of what is already among us. Everywhere there are trembling and whispers, insinuations and murmurs. Everywhere the light wind blows, the breeze that provokes the immense whiplash each time it unwinds in the air. Already many carry the purple insignia in their flesh. The light wind rises from the meadows of the past, and hurries closer to our time.","author":"Octavio Paz","entry_meta":"(1951)","id":146},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Around the Star’s Throne","text":"A sea of feathers billows.

In a loud voice he spoke of the great times to come, and in a quiet voice he taught the women how to boil crows and seagulls.

James Arnold Street Cries They were three street cries. One when spring had come, late in the afternoon, the balconies open, and floating up to them on the breeze a sharp aroma, rough and hard, that almost tickled your nose. People went by, women dressed in light, sheer fabrics; men, some in black wool or yellowish suits, and others in discolored white linen jackets and carrying wicker lunch trays, empty, on their way home from work. Then, a few streets over, the cry went up Carnations. Carnations! a slightly muffled cry, whose sound that sharp aroma, that same rough, scratchy scent that rose on the breeze to the opened balconies, converged with and merged in the scent of carnations. Dissolved in the air it had floated nameless, bathing the afternoon, until the cry betrayed it, giving it a voice and a sound, plunging it deep in your chest, like a knife whose scar time will never heal. The second street cry was at noon, in summer. The awning was unfurled over the patio, keeping the house cool and shady. The door to the street scarcely allowed an echo of light to penetrate the entryway. Water sounded in the drowsy fountain under its corona of green leaves. What a pleasure it was in the laziness of the summer noon, in that sleepy atmosphere, to rock in the wicker rocker. Everything was light, afloat; the world turned slowly, like a soap bubble, delicate, iridescent, unreal. And suddenly, from outside the doors, from the street flooded with sunlight, came the wild cry, like a moan of pleasure, Mackerel! The same as when you’re stirred from sleep in the middle of the night and that vague awakening brings with it just enough awareness that you can feel the surrounding calm and quiet, and you turn and fall back to sleep. There was in that cry a sudden bolt of gold and scarlet light, like lightning flashing through the darkness of an aquarium, that sent a sudden chill through your flesh. The world, having stopped for a moment, resumed its smooth turning, turning. The third cry was at nightfall, in autumn. The lamplighter had already passed, with his long hook on his shoulder, at whose far end flickered the little blue flame like a soul, lighting the streetlamps. The paving stones, damp from the first rains, shone under the bluish gas light. A balcony here, a door there, began to be lit up along the opposite wall, so close together in the narrow street. Then you could hear the blinds being lowered, the shutters closing. Through the balcony’s sheer curtain, his forehead pressed against the cold window, the little boy watched the street for a moment, waiting. Then came the voice of the old peddler, filling the dusk with his hoarse cry, Fresh lavender! the vowels closed in on themselves like the ululating call of an owl. He could be guessed at more than seen, dragging one foot behind him, stormcloud face beneath the hat brim fallen on him like a roof tile, moving, with his sack of lavender over his shoulder, to close the cycle of the year and of life itself. The first cry was the voice, the pure voice; the second the song, the melody; the third the memory and the echo, voice and melody now vanished.","author":"Luis Cernuda","entry_meta":"(1943)","id":150},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Rain","text":"The rain, in the courtyard where I watch it fall, comes down at very different speeds. In the centre, it is a fine discontinuous curtain or mesh, falling implacably but relatively slowly, a drizzle, a never-ending languid precipitation, an intense dose of pure meteor. Not far from the right and left walls heavier drops fall more noisily, separately. Here they seem to be about the size of a grain of wheat, there of a pea, elsewhere nearly a marble. On the moulding, on the window ledges, the rain runs horizontally while on the undersides of these same obstacles it is suspended, plump as a humbug. It streams across the entire surface of a little zinc roof the peephole looks down on, in a thin moiré sheet due to the different currents set in motion by the imperceptible undulations and bumps in the roofing. From the adjoining gutter, where it runs with the restraint of a brook in a nearly level bed, it suddenly plunges in a perfectly vertical, coarsely braided stream to the ground, where it splatters and springs up again flashing like needles. Each of its forms has a particular speed, each responds with a particular sound. The whole lives as intensely as a complicated mechanism, as precise as it is chancy, a clockwork whose spring is the weight of a given mass of precipitate vapour. The chiming of the vertical streams on the ground, the gurgling of the gutters, the tiny gong beats multiply and resound all at once in a concert without monotony, not without delicacy. When the spring is unwound, certain gears continue to function for a while, gradually slowing down, until the whole mechanism grinds to a halt. Then, if the sun comes out, everything is erased, the brilliant apparatus evaporates: it has rained.","author":"Francis Ponge","entry_meta":"(1942)","id":151},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The Pleasures of the Door","text":"Kings never touch doors.

Pull back the curtains, and see how the noiseless fire of sunrise eats down the chestnut trees. The still chestnut trees with their feet bathed with dew. There is work to be done, there are friends to be met; today is for laughter, and feet firmly planted on earth, as the dew quivers up into mid-day. The plate-glass river has caught and transposed the blue of the sky like a theme in music. Across the morning papers the metal-breasted squadrons engage, the furious tanks articulate with flame and the cannon charge in their hundreds, are burst in a rain of shells. There are voices proclaiming that heroes have died, that factories roar, that an abracadabra of figures makes triumph certain. A gruesome sensation, sharks follow a raft of torpedoed seamen for nine days and nights. Searching among the letters by the coffee-cup for one that still delays. There are three more posts today. A strange dream last night about the troop-train. Was I on my way to some distant front, or returning from the battle? What country was that half-lit ruined station in? How clearly I remember those friends of old days, my two companions. Their warm lips parted they tried to explain to me what was it? And yet they are a thousand miles away, perhaps in other armies; and if alive, who knows? But if death comes to me? Could happen any moment, any night of bombs and fire. Forget that darkness. Danger quickens the tide in the veins. Look, the summer-laden trees, the yellow irises along the wall, are more precious for the thought. Look with what style the young airmen march the street, and sailors fling the foam of their living into the smiles that greet them. Being is everything. There is work to be done. Telephones will be answered, letters posted, new problems faced like rivers, crossing improvised, achieved. Skill of hand or eye adorns triumphantly like flowers or medals. The tide of the day is at the full. Over the festivals of meat and wine, among the jostling tables, the chances of battle are debated; a new film that opened last night is appraised: a witty story told about a minister. Repulse, endurance, victory, the hero’s death, all glitter like mist that pearls above a fountain. But if this is only the scarf with which we hide despair? But if the pounding of the guns, the plunging of the massed bomb-racks rubs out, not just this house or that, but the whole monument of love and history? Sands have covered cities, every stone lost and skulls forgotten. Scattering of yesterday’s friends. Where are the words of love by the window, all the bubble and excitement round the fire? Does the web still hold we wove then? So frail it seems now, stretched to the edge of language by otherness of place and otherness of meaning. Across the evening paper the squadrons engage, the warships rock in the violent birth of their broadsides. There are prophets shouting in the wings, a grand transformation scene. Prophets, magicians, schemers: but the text is blurred. Is this the promised revolution that will atone for all? The last rung into sunlight? Or only an error, the miscarriage of machines? Does it matter? Changing is living. Music seduces, breaking from behind the curtain of a bar. We are one now, blood flows between us, meeting and parting, the brief exchange of fondness, is music, is singing, in the lights as we crowd by the piano in the bar. Goodnight, then, goodbye and God bless you. Let your latchkey into the door, look down eagerly among the scattered letters, the postman’s final visit for the day. Stamps, inks, envelopes, so many voices speaking up from them; but the longed for accents do not answer. Silence. A great wind is blowing from the centre. Hearths that were red yesterday are now dead ashes, and the wind blowing through the burst-open windows. If we hold on: but how much longer? The bells begin to chime the hour all over the town, recalling the sweetness of centuries, hope stored like honey in the clustered towers. There was a room once above the street, and your name over the door, and the bells chiming. But that is already like another life. Come back. There were dreams, there was faith. We must build. Come back from the white skulls and sandstorms of Africa, from the murderous teeth of the sea. Without your laughter confident beside me, without your answering and warm-veined hand, my feet, stepping for the solid earth, find only air.

He struck a match, set fire to the box, disappeared behind an enormous flame, and then stood before me. I recall his crimson smile and his vitreous eyes. A hurdy-gurdy in the street went on repeating the same note. I don’t know how to describe what he was wearing, but he kept making me think of a purple cypress. Gradually his arms began to separate from his taut body and to form a cross. Where did so many birds come from? It was as if he’d had them hidden under his wings. They flew clumsily, madly, violently, knocking against the walls of the narrow room, against the window-panes, then covered the floor as though wounded. I felt a warm layer of down and pulsations growing at my feet. I gazed at him, a strange fever possessed my body like a current coursing through it. When he’d finished raising his arms and his palms were together, he gave a sudden leap, as if the spring of a watch had broken in front of me. He knocked against the ceiling, making it echo with the sound of a cymbal, extended his right arm, seized the wire of the lamp, moved slightly, relaxed, then began to describe with his body a figure of eight against the darkness. The sight made me dizzy and I covered my face with both hands, crushing the darkness against my eyelids, while the hurdy-gurdy went on repeating the same note and then stopped abruptly. A sudden icy wind struck me; I felt my legs go numb. Now I also heard the low velvety sound of a flute, followed immediately by a heavy and regular beating. I opened my eyes and again saw him, standing tiptoe on a crystal sphere in the middle of the room, in his mouth a strange green flute over which he was running his fingers as though there were thousands of them. The birds now came back to life in an extraordinary order, rose up, mingled, formed into a cortège as wide as my outspread arms, and went out into the night through the window that was somehow open. When the last flutter had died away and only a suffocating smell of hunting was left, I decided to look him in the face. There was no face, above the purple body, seemingly headless, he sported a golden mask, of the kind found in Mycenaean tombs, with a pointed beard reaching down to the throat. I tried to get up, but I’d hardly made the first movement when a cataclysmic sound, like a pile of kettledrums collapsing in a funeral march, rooted me to the spot. It was the mask. His face appeared again as I’d originally seen it the eyes, the smile, and something which I now remarked for the first time: the white skin suspended from two black curls that pinned it into place at the temples. He tried to leap but no longer possessed his initial agility. I think he even stumbled against a book fallen there by accident, and he knelt down on one knee. Now I could observe him carefully. I saw the pores of his skin oozing fine beads of sweat. Something like breathlessness came over me. I tried to discover why his eyes had seemed so strange. He closed them and began to get up; but it must have been terribly difficult, for he seemed to concentrate all his strength without being able to do anything. He even knelt now on the other knee as well. The white skin seemed terribly pale, like yellow ivory, and his black hair was lifeless. Though I was witnessing an agonizing struggle, I had the feeling that I was better, that I’d triumphed over something. Before I could draw breath I saw him, fallen full length now, plunge into a green pagoda portrayed on my carpet.","author":"George Seferis","entry_meta":"(1940)","id":155},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"The Right Meaning","text":"Mother, you know there is a place somewhere called Paris. It’s a huge place and a long way off and it really is huge. My mother turns up my coat collar, not because it’s starting to snow, but in order that it may start. My father’s wife is in love with me, walking up, always keeping her back to my birth, and her face toward my death. Because I am hers twice, by my goodbye and by my coming home. When I return home, I close her. That is why her eyes gave me so much, pronounced innocent of me, caught in the act of me, everything occurs through finished arrangements, through covenants carried out. Has my mother confessed me, has she been named publicly? Why doesn’t she give so much to my other brothers? To Victor, for example, the oldest, who is so old now that people say, He looked like his father’s youngest brother. It must be because I have travelled so much! It must be because I have lived more! My mother gives me illuminated permissions to explore my coming-home tales. Face to face with my returning-home life, remembering that I journeyed for two whole hearts through her womb, she blushes and goes deathly pale when I say in the discourse of the soul: That night I was happy! But she grows more sad, she grew more sad. And she walks firmly through the color yellow to cry, because I seem to her to be getting old, on the blade of a sword, in the delta of my face. Weeps with me, grows sad with me. Why should my youth be necessary, if I will always be her son? Why do mothers feel pain when their sons get old, if their age will never equal anyway the age of the mothers? And why, if the sons, the more they get on, merely come nearer to the age of the fathers? My mother cries because I am old in my time and because I will never get old enough to be old in hers! My goodbyes left from a point in her being more toward the outside than the point in her being to which I come back. I am, because I am so overdue coming back, more the man to my mother than the son to my mother. The purity that lights us both now with three flames lies precisely in that. I say then until I finally fall silent: Mother, you know there is this place somewhere called Paris. It’s a huge place and a long way off and it really is huge. The wife of my father, hearing my voice, goes on eating her lunch, and her eyes that will die descend gently along my arms.","author":"Vallejo","entry_meta":"(1939)","id":156},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Blue Notebook, No. 10","text":"There once lived a red-headed man who had no eyes or ears.

Positive movements of transgression carry the sea and its deposits over the lands, drowning them and their features under tens or hundreds of fathoms of water. Efforts to advance the prosperity of the country should be directed towards building on the foundations already laid by the native himself, rather than to hazardous introductions or innovations. Commercial possibilities are not clearly and courageously visualized, and the new ventures are often the product and concern of individuals facing the traditional difficulties of lonely pioneers. The indoor staff remains comparatively small. The vigour of mountain building, of volcanoes, and of other manifestations of unrest, has shown no sign of senility or lack of energy. An operator received concussion and a wound on the head from a cast-iron cover blown off a 60A switch-fuse box. Geodesists have welcomed escape from the rising and sinking of the crust. To follow their food from over-grazed or sunscorched regions they required to be able to migrate easily and quickly. Today you cannot fight summer-heat with haphazard measures. The fermenting mass is turned three times. Nevertheless the gates are not kept locked and there is a considerable freedom to the public provided no fires are lighted and respect is shown for the plantations. Colonel Popham, who began work as a tea planter, murmured, They say a man is too old at forty. Or is it fifty? I think it must be seventy or eighty. I speak four different Chinese dialects fluently. It helped a lot. Then the slump came and trade went stagnant. I have lost all my money, but I can always earn more. As soon as I have saved up enough I shall put it all into another show. What is money for? If it is to be spent it finds work for a lot of people and keeps in circulation. Our seventy-eight-year-old customer said he had taken the umbrella with him round the world, through jungles and across prairies. He boasted that he had never lost it because he would never lend it. He brought it to us to be re-covered. That was less than five years ago. We now occupy three floors of the building where we began, and have overflowed into an adjoining building. No company such as this with a fine tradition for honest dealing with native peoples can remain in a depressed condition for an indefinite period. A reorganization scheme has been delayed owing to some difference of opinion with the American Guggenheim interests. That has now been settled, and the way is clear for the reorganization plan. London could be reached in twenty minutes. Rows of imposing neon-lighted shops erected. Supercinemas built. The mountains heaved up like a rough sea for twelve miles, and the hamlet with its 200 inhabitants disappeared. Two mailcoaches arrived safely at their destination, but with the drivers frozen dead in their seats. Trains were buried for three days. London awoke to chaos on the 19th. The snow lay a uniform solid three feet thick and fifteen feet in drifts. Many boats careered wildly along the road, crashing into houses and other buildings on the river bank. The crew of the Strathrye soaked their beds in paraffin and ignited them to attract attention. Days were passed in making shrouds, in farewells, in drinking holy thin soup. The schools were empty so that the whole family could die together, and no debts were paid. Shortly after midnight a great light was seen to be appearing on the high hills a little way off. As the light became brighter they shrieked and lamented and wrapped themselves in white cloth. The light, however, turned out to be the primitive acetylene lights of an early motorcar. The aborigines immediately proceeded to take the carburettor to bits with a great deal of interested chatter that thoroughly frightened the traveller. To his amazement they then put the pieces together again, after which the engine worked perfectly and the boat went on its way. A man of fifty-nine will sit next Sunday on a divan of cloth of gold and precious stones. Ten million people in all parts of the East will give thanks. He looks beautiful. His neck has grown straight and supple. He swings his head about more than usual, as if he enjoys the movement. Fir bushes grow around, the path has been kept weeded, but no one visits this strange, empty mausoleum. Mrs King has resolutely refused to allow the body to be taken out of her home. She still regards him as living. He was interested in the stock market. But in New York the market closes at 3 p.m., which is noon in Hollywood. The rest of the day was empty. He had no hobbies. He went from one extreme to the other. He tore his nervous system to shreds worrying over grievances, more often imaginary than real. Then suddenly he would thrust his worries from him and be the most gay, charming, high-spirited companion in the world, full of a vaulting optimism as little justified as his depths of gloom. He had said that he made his wife an annual allowance up to 1917, when he gave her two factories. Then he was in poor circumstances and could not do any more. At last I found what it was, he said. I wanted to see my wife. I wanted her to grumble at me for eating the wrong food and wearing the wrong clothes. Pretty bunches of evenly sized bright pink and yellow sticks may attract her and increase the sales of rhubarb, which have been declining for some years. This is an interesting Government. And a strange one. It is big. Very big. It is strong. Very strong. Yet all the three leaders of it are discredited. Far from being extinguished the antelope has become a menace, since it is roaming the south-west of the province in herds, and farmers are imploring the Government to protect them from it. Even the most thorough-going rogues have enjoyed such popularity that thousands of admirers have refused to believe any ill of them, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. Japan, for instance, has had her representatives in special training for weeks at a camp near the old Shogun city of Kamakura. What we have to do is to listen to the tiny voice of conscience and not smother it. In the past two or three weeks I have been visiting armaments works. The net result of my conclusions is that I do not think the country can afford to allow valuable men like Sir Charles Craven to be wasting their time giving evidence before armaments commissions. It takes around eight months to make a 4&dot;7-inch gun. It does seem to me a poor kind of compliment to the intelligence of the councillors to suggest that they do not know their own minds from one day to the next. As they must not leave their room during the deliberation, which will be long, twelve beds have been installed for them. In the course of yesterday, the successive bulletins were of a more reassuring nature, The most probable cause is the present state of flux in native life, the disappearance of tribal discipline, and the results of undigested education. It is possible to change some factors; it is not possible to change geography. These reassurances did not everywhere produce the desired effect. On the third day, using wire ropes, the wreck was lifted to the surface, but a swell on the sea made it impossible to get it onto the lighter. The ropes snapped, and the flying-boat drifted for 100 ft., and sank in 60 ft. of water, where it remained. As the day wore on, and the anticyclone began to withdraw to the Continent, three quarters of those present made for the door. There was no panic. They could go on their way peacefully, because they were strong.","author":"Charles Madge","entry_meta":"(1937)","id":158},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"Lozanne","text":"It was seven, it was nine o’clock, the doors were closing, the windows were screaming. You bent over the shadow that lay on the floor and saw its eyes dissolving. The band about your forehead began to turn. The band of fever. The armchair turned into a palace, the carpet became a bank of withered flowers, and then it was time to go. Every semblance of that which had gone before became the means by which you ascended the great staircase. And took your place among the stars. For it is significant, is it not, that the blemish about which you were so insistent was nothing less than that interminable voice which haunted you in your dreams, saying I love you over and over again. And the panelling of the room where they asked you questions was made of exactly the same wood as the mallet which you had to hate. The dusty and ashen residue of a passion that now raged elsewhere, but still raged, rose slowly upwards to the surface of the lake as your blood sank slowly through it. And the other returned to ice. Oh, I can see through your eyes now and I can see what flame it was that melted everything before it. Though the obstinate sod refused to become softened by the rain of thaw. But you were spared passing through that black box where a masked man kisses his victim before her death.

The glass that gathers and relinquishes forms: glass with a coastline, glass with the whole forest refracted through its gorgeousness, in the windows of the poor; glass of the goblets where the wine believes it is alone, rising straight up in the air like a miracle, in which the water thinks of itself as a brimless fountain. Glass that holds the lamp’s flame and whose cheek doesn’t burn. The glass, always as happy as the righteous, without stains of its own, without tears of its own, though burdened by others tears, innocent as an Abel of the earth. The glass without veins for blood or joints like wrists; the unanimous glass: the glass that doesn’t thicken or endure anything superfluous: sufficient, like something perfect. The glass, my soul’s only envy. The glass that helped water in its desire to remain, to lie in the hollow of the hand without treachery, to be loyal to the eye that watches and loved it, like a loyal woman: that gave the water a second body, one that doesn’t escape like an arrow, crazed with its own modest restraint. The glass of our windows, where night rests its hands like a great ivy, so that it can be seen and so that we don’t completely forget it. The glass of my desire: the glass that sits still in the midst of the ferment of creatures; that will never boil; that will never belong to anyone but itself. The glass, fresh as a temple is always fresh, preserved from old age since its earliest day, with its enduring childhood, with no pretty growth and no ugly growth. The glass discovered with joy, like a Christ, by men who have never since been able to find anything better than that discovery. The glass that always emerges as something of a surprise, something unexpected, from the hands of the workers, who always feel a bit abashed that it comes out resembling the soul, as it leaves their black and knotted hands. The workers who made glass all their lives arrived in heaven and found that it resembled what they had made on earth: a glass purified of distance, of large and small dimensions: in which God was so far away and so close that it frightened them. Without knowing it, they had been trapped in a glass reproduced with their faces, their shoulders, their feet, and they saw their second shoulders and their feet freed from corruption. They still experience the shock of learning that they too were made of glass material as they moved through their workshop casting hard shadows against the walls. The glassworkers compensated with their hands, which went through the fire like the salamander straightening and calming the crucibles. The metalworkers came to a violent copper heaven; they are happy in their violent joy. The woodworkers came to a heaven that smelled of maritime pines, a heaven echoless, still, and dry as old age. The glassworkers in their heaven watch the others: the copper heaven, the pine heaven, and the others too.","author":"Gabriela Mistral","entry_meta":"(1933)","id":160},{"source":"Penguin_Prose_Poems","title":"from The Orators","text":"Lo, I a skull show you, exuded from dyke when no pick was by pressure of bulbs, at Dalehead a light moving, lanterns for lambing. Before the forenoon of discussion, as the dawn-gust wrinkles the pools, I waken with an idea of building. Speak the name only with meaning only for us, meaning Him, a call to our clearing. Secret the meeting in time and place, the time of the off-shore wind, the place where the loyalty is divided. Meeting of seven, each with a talent. On the concrete banks of baths, in the grassy squares of exercise, we are joined, brave in the long body, under His eye. Their annual games under the auspices of the dead. Our bond, friend, is a third party. Smile inwardly on their day handing round tea. Their women have the faces of birds. Walking in the mountains we were persons unknown to our parents, awarded them little, had a word of our own for our better shadow. Crossing ourselves under the arch of a bridge we crucified fear. Crofter, leader of hay, working in sweat and weathers, tin-streamer, heckler, blow-room major, we are within a vein’s distance of your prisoned blood. Stranger who cannot read our letters, you are remembered. Rooks argue in the clump of elms to the left. Expect what dream above the indented heel, end-on to traffic, down the laurelled drive? At the frontier getting down, at railhead drinking hot tea waiting for pack-mules, at the box with the three levers watching the swallows. Choosing of guides for the passage through gorges. The young mother in the red kerchief suckling her child in the doorway, and the dog fleaing itself in the hot dust. Clatter of nails on the inn’s flagged floor. The hare-lipped girl sent with as far as the second turning. Talk of generals in a panelled room translated into a bayonet thrust at a sunbrowned throat, wounds among wheat fields. Grit from the robbers track on goggles, a present from aunts. Interrogation of villagers before a folding table, a verbal trap. Execution of a spy in the nettled patch at the back of the byre. A tale of sexual prowess told at a brazier and followed by a maternal song. The fatty smell of drying clothes, smell of cordite in a wood, and the new moon seen along the barrel of a gun. Establishment of a torpedo base at the head of the loch; where the bye-roads meet, a depot for tractors, with sliding doors. Visit to a tannery in the hill-village where the stream runs under the houses; to the mine with obsolete machinery, an undershot wheel, steam pipes in the open, swaddled in sacking. Designs for the flow sheet of a mill. Sound of our hammers in the solemn beat of a quarry, and the packing of labelled specimens in japanned boxes. Theories inter-relating the system of feudal tenure with metabolic gradients, and arguments from the other side of the lake on the formation of hanging valleys, interrupted by the daughter of the house with a broken doll. Writing reports for Him in the copper-green evenings. Trunks caught by the grapnel dragged inert towards the spurting saw, ewers of warm milk, the sugary layer under the rind, and pipe-lines clamped to the rock and at the tiny post-office, His word waiting. If it were possible, yes, now certain. To meet Him alone on the narrow path, forcing a question, would show our unique knowledge. Would hide Him wounded in a cave, kneeling all night by His bed of bracken, bringing hourly an infusion of bitter herbs; wearing His cloak receive the mistaken stab, deliver His message, fall at His feet, He gripping our moribund hands, smiling. But never for us with notebooks there, a league of two or three waiting for low water to execute His will. The tripod shadow falls on the dunes. World of the Spider, not Him. Rook shadows cross to the right. A schoolmaster cleanses himself at half-term with a vegetable offering; on the north side of the hill, one writes with his penis in a patch of snow Resurgam’. Going abroad to-day? Under a creaking sign, one yellow leg drawn up, he crows, the cock. The dew-wet hare hangs smoking, garotted by gin. The emmet looks at sky through lenses of fallen water. Sound of horns in the moist spring weather, and the women tender. I feel sorry for you I do. Girls, it is His will just now that we get up early. But watching the morning dredger, picking the afternoon fruit, wait; do not falsify our obedience. When we shuffle at night late round up-country stoves, although in waders, a dance of males, it is your hour; remember. It is your art just now against the inner life. Parting by hangars we are sorry but reborn. Wrap gifts in clothes, prepare a present for a simpler nation. A heliograph seen from below, a camera with smuggled lenses: a soured drink for the tongue, a douche for the unpopular member, a dream dirt-cheap for the man of action. Leave the corks behind as warning of wires, let the shafts be fenced as before, leave ordinary kindness. Going abroad to-night? The face lit up by the booking-clerk’s window. Poetry of the waiting-room. Is it wise, the short adventure on the narrow ship? The boat-train dives accomplished for the hoop of the tunnel; over the derne cutting lingering, its white excreta. Too late: smelling the first sea-weed we may not linger. The waving handkerchiefs recede and the gulls wheel after screaming for scraps. Throb of turbines below water, passing the mud islands, the recurrent light. Past. Handrail, funnel, oilskins, them, His will.

You put one foot in front of the other and then you are gone. The walls cover themselves with pictures, the holidays sift themselves with bouquets, the mirror covers itself with vapour. As many light-houses on a stream and the stream is in the vessel of the river. Two eyes the same, for the use of your single face two eyes covered with the same ants. Green is almost uniformly spread over the plants, the wind follows the birds, no one risks seeing the stones die. The result is not a broken-in animal but an animal trainer. Bah! It is the indefeasible order of a ceremony already, on the whole, so very gorgeous! It is the repeating pistol which makes flowers appear in vases and smoke in the mouth. Love, in the end, is well satisfied with seeing night clearly. When you are no longer there, your perfume is there to search for me. I only come to get back the oracle of your weakness. My hand in your hand is so little like your hand in mine. Unhappiness, you see, unhappiness itself profits from being known.

The row of white, sparkling shop-fronts is gashed and bleeding, it bleeds red slippers.

And it is now that our two paths cross. Both simultaneously recognize his Anti-type: that I am an Arcadian, that he is a Utopian. He notes, with contempt, my Aquarian belly: I note, with alarm, his Scorpion’s mouth. He would like to see me cleaning latrines: I would like to see him removed to some other planet. Neither speaks. What experience could we possibly share? Glancing at a lampshade in a store window, I observe it is too hideous for anyone in their senses to buy: He observes it is too expensive for a peasant to buy. Passing a slum child with rickets, I look the other way: He looks the other way if he passes a chubby one. I hope our senators will behave like saints, provided they don’t reform me: He hopes they will behave like baritoni cattivi, and, when lights burn late in the Citadel, I who have never seen the inside of a police station am shocked and think: Were the city as free as they say, after sundown all her bureaus would be huge black stones.: He who has been beaten up several times is not shocked at all but thinks: One fine night our boys will be working up there. You can see, then, why, between my Eden and his New Jerusalem, no treaty is negotiable. In my Eden a person who dislikes Bellini has the good manners not to get born: In his New Jerusalem a person who dislikes work will be very sorry he was born. In my Eden we have a few beam-engines, saddle-tank locomotives, overshot waterwheels and other beautiful pieces of obsolete machinery to play with: In his New Jerusalem even chefs will be cucumber-cool machine minders. In my Eden our only source of political news is gossip: In his New Jerusalem there will be a special daily in simplified spelling for non-verbal types. In my Eden each observes his compulsive rituals and superstitious tabus but we have no morals: In his New Jerusalem the temples will be empty but all will practice the rational virtues. One reason for his contempt is that I have only to close my eyes, cross the iron footbridge to the tow-path, take the barge through the short brick tunnel and there I stand in Eden again, welcomed back by the krumhorns, doppions, sordumes of jolly miners and a bob major from the Cathedral romanesque of St. Sophie Die Kalte: One reason for my alarm is that, when he closes his eyes, he arrives, not in New Jerusalem, but on some august day of outrage when hellikins cavort through ruined drawing-rooms and fish-wives intervene in the Chamber or some autumn night of delations and noyades when the unrepentant thieves including me are sequestered and those he hates shall hate themselves instead. So with a passing glance we take the other’s posture: Already our steps recede, heading, incorrigible each, towards his kind of meal and evening.

But there the moon seems to hang motionless in the sky. It gives very little light; it could be dead. Visibility is poor. Nevertheless, we shall try to give you some idea of the lay of the land and the present situation. The escarpment that rises abruptly from the central plain is in heavy shadow, but the elaborate terracing of its southern glacis gleams faintly in the dim light, like fish scales. What endless labor those small, peculiarly shaped terraces represent. And yet, on them the welfare of this tiny principality depends. A slight landslide occurred in the northwest about an hour ago. The exposed soil appears to be of poor quality, almost white, calcareous, and shaly. There are believed to have been no casualties. Almost due north, our aerial reconnaissance reports the discovery of a large rectangular field, hitherto unknown to us, obviously man-made. It is dark-speckled. An airstrip? A cemetery? In this small, backward country, one of the most backward left in the world today, communications are crude and industrialization and its products almost nonexistent. Strange to say, however, signboards are on a truly gigantic scale. We have also received reports of a mysterious, oddly shaped, black structure, at an undisclosed distance to the east. Its presence was revealed only because its highly polished surface catches such feeble moonlight as prevails. The natural resources of the country being far from completely known to us, there is the possibility that this may be, or may contain, some powerful and terrifying secret weapon. On the other hand, given what we do know, or have learned from our anthropologists and sociologists about this people, it may well be nothing more than a numen, or a great altar recently erected to one of their gods, to which, in their present historical state of superstition and helplessness, they attribute magical powers, and may even regard as a savior, one last hope of rescue from their grave difficulties. At last! One of the elusive natives has been spotted! He appears to be—rather, to have been—a unicyclist-courier, who may have met his end by falling from the height of the escarpment because of the deceptive illumination. Alive, he would have been small, but undoubtedly proud and erect, with the thick, bristling black hair typical of the indigenes. From our superior vantage point, we can clearly see into a sort of dugout, possibly a shell crater, a nest of soldiers. They lie heaped together, wearing the camouflage battle dress intended for winter warfare. They are in hideously contorted positions, all dead. We can make out at least eight bodies. These uniforms were designed to be used in guerrilla warfare on the country’s one snow-covered mountain peak. The fact that these poor soldiers are wearing them here, on the plain, gives further proof, if proof were necessary, either of the childishness and hopeless impracticality of this inscrutable people, our opponents, or of the sad corruption of their leaders.","entry_meta":"(1976)","id":177},{"author":"CZESLAW MILOSZ","author_meta":"(1911–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Esse","text":"I looked at that face, dumbfounded.

Yes! What a buttonholing mariner! What a jack-in-the-box I am, but truly with a decent motive—to entertain, to be useful—and also to arrive at a point. What point? I do not actually know, except that there must be a point and when I get there I will recognize it, though I scarcely expect to get there very soon, and one who did would equal all the seven wonders of nature of the ancients—the camel, the rainbow, the echo, the cuckoo, the Negro, the volcano, and the sirocco. I have been thinking about justice. Naturally, look at what surrounds us. Justice: a fine word and immediately suggesting how beautiful a thing the fact must be, if there is such a fact, either possible or actual. A round, complete, self-contained datum, like an enormous globe radiating a dazzling light which illuminates every corner, subterfuge, and mystery between human beings, not creating, as the sun does being like all natural things involved in the dialectic of nature so many morbid shadows, and the black broom of night at once with the bright bloom of day. What could I think of, desiring to amuse as well as instruct, also to be pleased and to learn myself—of what but the ancient short story made known to me in childhood by my crippled father, a brief history which has prepossessed me to this day, even with the archness in which my poor father attempted to hide the essential viciousness and despair of the narrative. Once upon a time, said my father, seated in his wheel chair, and summoning unknowingly in that traditional opening the continuous present necessary to the interest of any story, Once upon a time, he repeated, an old farmer named Schrecklichkeitunendlich a name chosen to tickle me and his young son Hans, aged ten, went to town taking with them their brown pony named Ego. Ego, Father? I asked. That is a strange name for a pony or anyone else. No, no, said my bitter father, it is a well-known name. I have never heard of anyone with that name, I said stubbornly. Please, said my father, angered, if you continue to interrupt me, I will never finish the story, which you begged me to tell you. Father, son, and pony, my father continued, started for the market place, and Hans rode the pony. It was a beautiful blue-and-gold day in the month of June, and all three were pleased with all things, the father because he was going to sell the pony and with the proceeds buy a gun with which to kill deer, the son because he had been promised a pair of boxing gloves by the father, and the pony merely glad because he was exercising himself and the weather was fine. The three travelers had gone but a mile—the town being four miles distant—when a man with a whip came along from the opposite direction, and seeing them, said indignantly: O pitiless boy! You who are young and strong ride the pony, while your father, the weak old man, walks beside you and by such exertion shortens his days. Get down from the pony, let your father ride, honor your father, remember his weakness. Intimidated by this, father and son said nothing, the traveler went on his way absentmindedly, Hans dismounted, and his father mounted the pony. But they should have had two ponies, I said to my father. They had only one, my father replied. The number of ponies is not infinite. Many people have only one pony, and as for us, as you know, we have none, said my father in his embittered voice and continued. They went forward another mile and another stranger approached, holding a gun in his hand, stopped them, took the pony by the halter, standing there as if he were an official authority: Evil old man, he said. Selfish father! The young boy must walk while the father rides, as if he were a king and would like to live forever. A king, Father? I inquired. Kings do not live forever. No one does. By king, I meant an important person, he said annoyed and impatient. Do not, please, interrupt me so often. The stranger stood there so threateningly that the father dismounted. Satisfied, the stranger passed on, leaving father and son completely perplexed, not knowing at all what to do. Suddenly Hans was inspired: Father, Father! he said. We will both ride the pony. The father saw how intelligent this idea was and said with pride: Hans, you are a smart boy, and soon both were mounted on the pony and jogging toward town. The pony’s pace slowed up a bit, but not otherwise did he show himself troubled by the additional weight. But soon a third stranger came along, saw them and stopped them. This one brandished a sword and said, in a tone of the greatest moral indignation and self-righteousness: O heartless humans! Both of you riding one weak and young pony! What ruthless cruelty toward the dumb and inoffensive beast! Dismount before you kill him, or I will report you to both the civil and sacred authorities! Both father and son dismounted hurriedly, and clumsily for it is difficult for two to dismount from a horse at the same time. Something is always wrong, said the father aloud, as he dismounted and the stranger, satisfied, departed. Hans, said the father, we will both walk and the pony will walk beside us. Then perhaps all will be content. No sooner had he said this than a fourth stranger appeared. Hans drew back and wished to hide in the wood until the stranger passed, especially since the newcomer carried a whip, and a gun, and a sword. But the father decided against hiding. What is wrong with you? said the stranger in a voice whose kindliness stunned them with surprise. Why don’t you ride the pony? Why are you so stupid? What is a pony for, if not to ride? Then the stranger passed on, before they could tell him of the difficulties involved in riding the pony. Desperate by this time, the farmer said: Son, only one choice remains. If either of us ride the pony, we will remain at the mercy of these denunciations of the first, second, and third class. We must carry the pony, then perhaps all sides will be satisfied. ‘The pony may not like it, Father. ‘He is silent. If he says anything, we will whip him. And so they lifted the pony on their backs, although it was a difficult and clumsy thing to do. Father, I said at this point, in disbelief, you are inventing this story. You ought not to tell me falsehoods. No one carries a pony upon his back. That is ridiculous. My father was greatly angered and slapped me savagely, making me howl with pain. Don’t ever call your father a liar, he said. It’s enough that your mother does so. Finish the story, Father, please, I said meekly, weeping. After a slow and painful effort, the farmer and Hans managed to reach the market place, carrying the pony upon their backs and looking very strange. In the market place, idlers were congregated, who, when they saw this sight, began to laugh and their laughter increased in intensity and volume.

The leader, the biggest wiseacre of all, answered: Why, you damned fool! Whoever heard of carrying a pony? A pony is supposed to carry you. Their laughter increased still more at this sally, and the farmer felt completely helpless—at the end of his rope—and besides he could not stand being laughed at, being very sensitive. So he took out his revolver, which he had had in his pocket all the while, and—bang! bang! bang!—shot the pony, shot his son, and, shrugging his shoulders, and brushing the hair back from his forehead, shot himself. My mother entered at this moment and began to argue with my father for telling the child such a story, and soon all the hate between them made each bring up past wrongs on each other’s part, and in their heat they forgot my presence and spoke shamelessly and brutally, while I wept loudly, watching them, weeping because of the sad end of the story, because they were denouncing each other and because I had been slapped for calling my father a liar.","entry_meta":"(1938)","id":182},{"author":"DAVID IGNATOW","author_meta":"(1914–1997)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","text":"I sink back upon the ground, expecting to die.

We were tired, had walked a lot, had sat down at a large, generic big-square café. Dear though it may be to its proprietors and its habitués, it seemed ordinary enough to us. So we sat there and she ordered a Beaujolais and I, a beer. After two swallows of the beer, I was overcome by a feeling of happiness. I told her and I told her again about it later. She had a theory about a happiness base. Once, she said, you had this base, at odd times, moments of true happiness could occur. Without the base, however, they would not. The base was made of good health, good work, good friendship, good love. Of course, you can have all these and not be happy. You have to have the base, and then be lucky, she said.

And they begin. How weird the goalies look with their African masks. The goalie is so lonely anyway, guarding a basket with nothing in it, his wide lower legs wide as ducks’... No matter what gift he is given, he always rejects it... He has a number like 1, a name like Mrazek, sometimes wobbling on his legs waiting for the puck, or curling up like a baby in the womb to hold it, staying a second too long on the ice. The goalie has gone out to mid-ice, and now he sails sadly back to his own box, slowly; he looks prehistoric with his rhinoceros legs; he looks as if he’s going to become extinct, and he’s just taking his time... When the players are at the other end, he begins sadly sweeping the ice in front of his house; he is the old witch in the woods, waiting for the children to come home. They all come hurrying back toward us, suddenly, knees dipping like oil wells; they rush toward us wildly, fins waving, they are pike swimming toward us, their gill fins expanding like the breasts of opera singers; no, they are twelve hands practicing penmanship on the same piece of paper... They flee down the court toward us like birds, swirling two and two, hawks hurrying for the mouse, hurrying down wind valleys, swirling back and forth like amoebae on the pale slide, as they sail in the absolute freedom of water and the body, untroubled by the troubled mind, only the body, with wings as if there were no grave, no gravity, only the birds sailing over the cottage far in the deep woods... Now the goalie is desperate... he looks wildly over his left shoulder, rushing toward the other side of his cave, like a mother hawk whose chicks are being taken by two snakes... Suddenly he flops on the ice like a man trying to cover a whole double bed. He has the puck. He stands up, turns to his right, and drops it on the ice at the right moment; he saves it for one of his children, a mother hen picking up a seed and then dropping it... But the men are all too clumsy, they can’t keep track of the puck... no, it is the puck, the puck is too fast, too fast for human beings, it humiliates them constantly. The players are like country boys at the fair watching the con man—The puck always turns up under the wrong walnut shell... They come down ice again, one man guiding the puck this time... and Ledingham comes down beautifully, like the canoe through white water, or the lover going upstream, every stroke right, like the stallion galloping up the valley surrounded by his mares and colts, how beautiful, like the body and soul crossing in a poem... The player in position pauses, aims, pauses, cracks his stick on the ice, and a cry as the puck goes in! The goalie stands up disgusted, and throws the puck out... The player with a broken stick hovers near the cage. When the play shifts, he skates over to his locked-in teammates, who look like a nest of bristling owls, owl babies, and they hold out a stick to him... Then the players crash together, their hockey sticks raised like lobster claws. They fight with slow motions, as if undersea... they are fighting over some woman back in the motel, but like lobsters they forget what they’re battling for; the clack of the armor plate distracts them, and they feel a pure rage. Or a fighter sails over to the penalty box, where ten-year-old boys wait to sit with the criminal, who is their hero... They know society is wrong, the wardens are wrong, the judges hate individuality... And this man with his peaked mask, with slits, how fantastic he is, like a white insect who has given up on evolution in this life; his family hopes to evolve after death, in the grave. He is ominous as a Dark Ages knight... the Black Prince. His enemies defeated him in the day, but every one of them died in their beds that night... At his father’s funeral, he carried his own head under his arm. He is the old woman in the shoe, whose house is never clean, no matter what she does. Perhaps this goalie is not a man at all, but a woman, all women; in her cage everything disappears in the end; we all long for it. All these movements on the ice will end, the seats will come down, the stadium walls bare... This goalie with his mask is a woman weeping over the children of men, that are cut down like grass, gulls that stand with cold feet on the ice... And at the end, she is still waiting, brushing away before the leaves, waiting for the new children developed by speed, by war ...","entry_meta":"(1972)","title":"UNTITLED","id":192},{"author":"ROBERT BLY","author_meta":"(1926–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Warning to the Reader","text":"Sometimes farm granaries become especially beautiful when all the oats or wheat are gone, and wind has swept the rough floor clean.

The ebony hands of the clock always seem to mark the same hour. That is why it always seems the same, though it is of course changing constantly, subtly, as though fed by an underground stream. If only we could go out in back, as when we were kids, and smoke and fool around and just stay out of the way, for a little while. But that’s just it—don’t you see? We are out in back. No one has ever used the front door. We have always lived in this place without a name, without shame, a place for grownups to talk and laugh, having a good time. When we were children it seemed that adulthood would be like climbing a tree, that there would be a view from there, breathtaking because slightly more elusive. But now we can see only down, first down through the branches and further down the surprisingly steep grass patch that slopes away from the base of the tree. It certainly is a different view, but not the one we expected. What did they want us to do? Stand around this way, monitoring every breath, checking each impulse for the return address, wondering constantly about evil until necessarily we fall into a state of torpor that is probably the worst sin of all? To what purpose did they cross-hatch so effectively, so that the luminous surface that was underneath is transformed into another, also luminous but so shifting and so alive with suggestiveness that it is like quicksand, to take a step there would be to fall through the fragile net of uncertainties into the bog of certainty, otherwise known as the Slough of Despond? Probably they meant for us to enjoy the things they enjoyed, like late summer evenings, and hoped that we’d find others and thank them for providing us with the wherewithal to find and enjoy them. Singing the way they did, in the old time, we can sometimes see through the tissues and tracings the genetic process has laid down between us and them. The tendrils can suggest a hand; or a specific color—the yellow of the tulip, for instance—will flash for a moment in such a way that after it has been withdrawn we can be sure that there was no imagining, no auto-suggestion here, but at the same time it becomes as useless as all subtracted memories. It has brought certainty without heat or light. Yet still in the old time, in the faraway summer evenings, they must have had a word for this, or known that we would someday need one, and wished to help. Then it is that a kind of purring occurs, like the wind sneaking around the baseboards of a room, not the infamous still, small voice but an ancillary speech that is parallel to the slithering of our own doubt-fleshed imaginings, a visible soundtrack of the way we sound as we move from encouragement to despair to exasperation and back again, with a gesture sometimes that is like an aborted movement outward toward some cape or promontory from which the view would extend in two directions—backward and forward—but that is only a polite hope in the same vein as all the others, crumpled and put away, and almost not to be distinguished from any of them, except that it knows we know, and in the context of not knowing is a fluidity that flashes like silver, that seems to say a film has been exposed and an image will, most certainly will, not like the last time, come to consider itself within the frame. It must be an old photograph of you, out in the yard, looking almost afraid in the crisp, raking light that afternoons in the city held in those days, unappeased, not accepting anything from anybody. So what else is new? I’ll tell you what is: you are accepting this now from the invisible, unknown sender, and the light that was intended, you thought, only to rake or glance is now directed full in your face, as it in fact always was, but you were squinting so hard, fearful of accepting it, that you didn’t know this. Whether it warms or burns is another matter, which we will not go into here. The point is that you are accepting it and holding on to it, like love from someone you always thought you couldn’t stand, and whom you now recognize as a brother, an equal. Someone whose face is the same as yours in the photograph but who is someone else, all of whose thoughts and feelings are directed at you, falling like a gentle slab of light that will ultimately loosen and dissolve the crusted suspicion, the timely self-hatred, the efficient cold directness, the horrible good manners, the sensible resolves and the senseless nights spent waiting in utter abandon, that have grown up to be you in the tree with no view; and place you firmly in the good-natured circle of your ancestors games and entertainments.","entry_meta":"(1984)","id":202},{"author":"JOHN ASHBERY","author_meta":"(1927–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Haibun 6","text":"To be involved in every phase of directing, acting, producing and so on must be infinitely rewarding.

So too with many of life’s little less-than-pleasurable experiences, like the rain that falls and falls for so long that no one can remember when it began or what weather used to be, or cares much either; they are much too busy trying to plug holes in ceilings or emptying pails and other containers and then quickly pushing them back to catch the overflow. But nobody seems eager to accord ideal status to this situation and I, for one, would love to know why. Don’t we realize that after all these centuries that are now starting to come apart like moldy encyclopedias in some abandoned, dusty archive that we have to take the bitter with the sweet or soon all distinctions will be submerged by the tide of tepid approval of everything that is beginning to gather force and direction as well? And when its mighty roar threatens in earnest the partially submerged bridges and cottages, picks up the floundering cattle to deposit them in trees and so on to who knows what truly horrible mischief, it will be time, then, to genuinely rethink this and come up with true standards of evaluation, only it will be too late of course, too late for anything but the satisfaction that lasts only just so long. A pity, though. Meanwhile I lift my glass to these black-and-silver striped nights.

Listening I heard also a man and woman talking together. I couldn’t hear very well but it seemed they were discussing the work that was being done. This made me smile, they sounded like good and dear people and I was slipping back into dreams when the phone rang. No one was there. Some of these are perhaps people having to do with anything in the world. I wish to go away, on a dark night, to leave people and the rain behind but am too caught up in my own selfish thoughts and desires for this.

I like this in a way but wish it would stop as the unexpectedness of it conflicts with my desire to revolve in a constant, deliberate motion. To drink tea from a samovar. To use chopsticks in the land of the Asiatics. To be stung by the sun’s bees and have it not matter. Most things don’t matter but an old woman of my acquaintance is always predicting doom and gloom and her prophecies matter though they may never be fulfilled. That’s one reason I don’t worry too much but I like to tell her she is right but also wrong because what she says won’t happen. Yet how can I or anyone know this? For the seasons do come round in leisurely fashion and one takes a pinch of something from each, according to one’s desires and what it leaves behind.

They were transparent. I was carried into the gorgeous dollhouse and placed on a fainting couch upholstered with brilliant poppies. My ship had come in, so to speak. There were others, lovers, sitting and speaking nearby. Are you the Countess of C.?, I demanded. She smiled and returned her gaze to the other. Someone brought in a tray of cakes which were distributed to the guests according to a fixed plan. Here, this one’s for you. Take it. I looked and saw only a small cat rolling in the snow of the darkened gutter. If this is mine, then I don’t want it. Abruptly the chords of a string quartet finished. I was on a shallow porch. The village movie palaces were letting out. I thought I saw a cousin from years back. Before I could call out she turned, sallow. I saw that this was not the person. Conversations continued streaming in the erstwhile twilight, I betook myself to the tollbooth. The pumpkin-yellow sun lit all this up, climbing slowly from ankles to handlebar. He had shaved his head some seven years ago. The lovers were bored then. They no longer meandered by the brook’s side, telling and retelling ancient secrets, as though this time of life were an anomaly, a handicap that had been foreseen. In truth these labels don’t go far. It was I who made a career in singing, but it could just as well have been somewhere else. Indeed? The dust was sweeping itself up, making sport of the broom. The solar disk was clogged with the bristles of impending resolution. Which direction did he say to take? I’m confused now, a little. It was my understanding we would in joining hands be chastised, that the boss man would be sympathetic, the sly apprentice unresonant as a squatter’s treehouse. See though, it wasn’t me that dictated ... that dictated the orbits of the plants, the viburnum at the door. And just as I had called to you, the image decomposed. Restlessness of fish in a deodorant ad. By golly, Uncle Ted will soon be here. Until it happens you can catch your breath, looking about the walls of the familiar nest. But his flight was delayed for five hours. Now someone was interested. The travel mishaps of others are truly absorbing. He read from a large timetable and the helium balloon rose straight up out of the city, entered the region of others indifference and their benighted cares. Can’t that child be made to stop practicing? In another life we were in a cottage made of thin boards, above a small lake. The embroidered hems of waves annoyed the shoreline. There were no boats, only trees and boathouses. It’s good to step off that steel carrousel. The woods were made for musicianly echoes, though not all at once. Too many echoes are like no echo, or a single tall one. Please return dishes to main room after using. Try a little subtlety in self-defence; it’ll help, you’ll find out. The boards of the cottage grew apart and we walked out into the sand under the sea. It was time for the sun to exhort the mute apathy of sitters, hangers-on. Ballast of the universal dredging operation. The device was called candy. We had seen it all before but would never let on, not until the postman came right up to the door, borne on the noble flood. Racked by jetsam, we cry out for flotsam, anything to stanch the hole in the big ad. We all came to be here quite naturally. You see we are the lamplighters of our criminal past, trailing red across the sidewalks and divided highways. Yes, she said, you most certainly can come here now and be assured of staying, of starving, forever if we wish, though we shall not observe the dark’s convolutions much longer sob. Utterly you are the under one, we are all neighbors if you wish, but don’t under any circumstances go crawling to the barrel organ for sympathy, you would only blow a fuse and where’s the force in that? I know your seriousness is long gone, facing pink horizons in other hemispheres. We’d all blow up if it didn’t. Meanwhile it’s nice to have a chair. A chair is a good thing to be.

We had learned thereafter to mock that stiff way of walking, and after that, to replace it with our own little dances and gallops; we roller-skated from room to room, or occasionally bicycled. Being confined by the layout was not the point, nor was it what may or may not have happened to the houses—whether they were indeed in ruins or merely in need of repair. We had all gone away somewhere: off to war, or to the city, or had shipped out for the East. And those of us who returned, or who had stayed wherever it was, came quite naturally to go about in the field, or among the hills or through the streets. At first, it was almost with memorized maps of the ways rooms opened off each other, and of just what courts it was on which the various windows gave; after that, with no recollected plan, but always moving the better for having started out in one of the great houses. But then it almost ceased to matter where we were. What had become necessary that we do by way of amble, or of hop skip and jump, had so taken over power from mere place that it generated the shapes of space through which it moved, like a lost, late arrival at the start of a quest who had set out nonetheless, dreaming each new region into which he wandered.

For their first meal at home she bakes a ham, preparing it as she always does, at the start slicing off both its ends before setting it in the pan. The ham is delicious, her husband delighted. Why do you make it that way, he later asks her, slicing the ends off? I don’t know why, she answers, except that I learned to do that from my mother. Curious, the husband asks his mother-in-law at their next meeting, Why do you slice both ends off the ham when you make it in the delicious way you taught your daughter? I don’t know why, she answers. I learned how to make it from my mother. The husband insists that he and his wife visit her grandmother, whom he again asks, You bake ham in a wonderful way that has been adopted by your daughter and then by your granddaughter. Can you tell me why in this recipe one slices off the ends of the ham before cooking it? Don’t know why they do it, the old lady replies, but when I made it, the ham wouldn’t fit in the pan. This fable, illustrating our inevitable ignorance about why things happen the way they do, was told to us on the first day of the More Time Course, which included many other goodies: how to avoid fatigue by sleeping less, how to manage disagreeable emotions by scheduling them, how to replace paying bills by making contributions to institutions one admires such as Con Ed, restaurants, taxicabs. In bright late-winter sunlight, your mail sits on a neighbor’s window-sill, leaning neatly stacked against the window. The child gets out of the car to fetch it. Back at the house, you take the envelopes and packages and open them eagerly, almost but you are a grown-up and know better feverishly. What will those sealed contents reveal? What changes small and great will they bring to your life? Questions both foolish and irresistible. As if something might change, as if the postman now a briskly efficient young woman might deliver to you the message, the ultimate message that you’ve been waiting all your life for, that would make your life clear and complete. Sometimes the ultimate message is in fact received. It reads, more or less: Your ligament issues from a spa that is given various narcissisms at various timetables: lozenge, credulity, goggles. And not only your ligament and that of others: the prodigy that generates mayday has the same orthography. You and the upkeep are one. Give up sugarbowls. At such moments you realize, and you remember, that such messages have never been lacking, and that they are all the same, and that the problem if that is the word doesn’t involve receiving but deciphering what is received again and again, day after day, minute after minute. The letter that made you happiest recently someone planned to devote an issue of his magazine to your work was opened without such expectation, without expectation of any kind. You found it deposited in your mailbox unusually early on a gray morning in Paris, where your important mail is rarely sent, on your way out to breakfast, still numb from sleep. If you decided to decode the ultimate message of two days ago, you might find the task less forbidding than it at first seemed. Encoding and decoding mean substitution: as a first step, replace all words in the message that strike you as obscure with their most likely dictionary definitions. The message then would read: Your connecting bond issues from a mineral spring that has attributed to it various [forms of] excessive love of yourself, according to the listings of various arrivals and departures: pleasantly flavored medication; gullibility; protective tinted spectacles. And not only your connecting bond and that of others: the fearful event that generates [your] signals of distress manifests the same method of representing sounds by literal symbols. You are one with the maintenance [of things] in proper operation, condition, and repair. Give up your covered sweets.—You already have been provided with more accessible meanings. The very process of discovering and transcribing started possibilities of interpretation flashing in your imagination: the mineral spring seemed to appear for the exact purpose of reflecting Narcissus... Much, if not all, of the message can be read as an injunction to give up pleasurable escapes cough drops, dark glasses, sugar and to accept the conditions of existence. Those conditions frighten you, but they also give you your life. That the conditions include a mineral spring and that you are connected to the proper operation of what is outside you imply a link with the inorganic world that remains hard to grasp. Furthermore the method of representing sounds by literal symbols, common to what binds you to the world and to the frightening event, demands investigation.","id":216},{"author":"MARK STRAND","author_meta":"(1934–)","title":"In the Privacy of the Home","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","text":"You want to get a good look at yourself.

When the butler told him the old lady had just gone out, but that the young lady was at home, he fumbled in his fur coat and dresscoat pocket, found his card, and said, Right. But it was not right. Driving from his house in the morning to pay a visit, he thought he was compelled to it by the conventions of society which weighed heavily upon him. But now it was clear that he went to pay calls only because somewhere far away in the depths of his soul, as under a veil, there lay hidden a hope that he would see Nadya, his secret love. And he suddenly felt pitiful, sad, and not a little anxious. In his soul, it seemed to him, it was snowing, and everything was fading away. He was afraid to love Nadya, because he thought he was too old for her, his appearance unattractive, and did not believe that a young woman like her could love a man for his mind or spiritual character. Everything was dim, sharing, he felt, the same blank character. Still, there would rise at times in him something like hope, a glimpse of happiness, of things turning out all right. Then, just as quickly, it would pass away. And he would wonder what had come over him. Why should he, a retired councillor of state, educated, liberal-minded, a well-traveled man; why should he, in other words, be so anxious? Were there not other women with whom he could fall in love? Surely, it was always possible to fall in love. It was possible, moreover, to fall in love without acting out of character. There was absolutely no need for him to be anxious. To be in love, to have a young pretty wife and children of his own, was not a crime or a deception, but his right. Clearly, there was something wrong with him. He wished he were far away... But suddenly he hears from somewhere in the house the young officer’s spurs jingle and then die away. That instant marked the death of his timid love. And in its vanishing, he felt the seeds of a different sort of melancholy take root within him. Whatever happened now, whatever desolation might be his, it would build character. Yes, he thought, so it is only right. Yes, all is finished, and I’m glad, very glad, yes, and I’m not let down, no, nor am I in any way anxious. No, certainly not anxious. What he had to do now was to get away. But how could he make it look right? How could he have thought he was in love? How out of character.

So, he knocked on the door. But no one opened it. He tried the knob, but it seemed to be stuck. He thought he heard a tumbler start to click inside the lock—but then it stopped. He bent down and attempted to pick the lock using the keys from his own apartment door—but of course, that produced absolutely no result whatsoever. Impatiently, he arose, walked back across the yard, and threw all his weight against the door from fifteen feet away.... but for some reason, that didn’t work either. Again and again he tried to break through that damned door, running at it across the yard from still greater and greater distances, but time after time nothing happened—except that the last time he threw his weight against it, the entire building came crashing down around it! And still, the door stood. Slowly, he backed up a dozen yards to the furthermost limits of the yard, which was surrounded by a fence; and once again launched himself at the door—but this time he only succeeded in smashing his spinal column! Finally, from his brand new wheelchair, he tried nuclear dynamite. The earth fell down around the door; he realized that the sky was falling—he actually moved both Heaven and Earth! Just before they fell, he managed to peer at eye-level from his wheelchair through the keyhole. But all he saw back there was someone holding up a small hand mirror—the tiny, inexpensive kind they sell at dime stores; and, in the center of the mirror, directly opposite the keyhole and looking directly back at him, was an eye.","entry_meta":"(1976)","id":221},{"author":"RUSSELL EDSON","author_meta":"(1935–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"A Performance at Hog Theater","text":"There was once a hog theater where hogs performed as men, had men been hogs.

In the mirror, every night, the same face, a bit more threadbare, a dress worn too long. The moon was out in the cold, along with the restless, dissatisfied wind that seemed to change the location of the sycamores. I expected reproaches because I had mentioned the word love, but you only accused me of stealing your pencil, and sadness disappeared with sense. You made a ceremony out of holding your head in your hands because, you said, it could not be contained in itself. In order to understand the nature of language you began to paint, thinking that the logic of reference would become evident once you could settle the quarrels of point, line, and color. I was distracted from sliding words along the scales of significance by smoke on my margin of breath. I waited for the flame, the passage from eye to world. At dawn, you crawled into bed, exhausted, warning me against drawing inferences across blind canvas. I ventured that a line might represent a tower that would reach the sky, or, on the other hand, rain falling. You replied that the world was already taking up too much space. At first sight, it did not look like a picture of your body. Any more than the fog rolling in from the sea, covering and uncovering the surface of the river, seemed an extreme. I made excuses for your hesitation because I thought you wanted to contain everything, unimpaired by spelling errors. Then I saw you were trying to lean against the weight of missing words, a wall at the end of the world. But I knew, though it tired me to imagine even a fraction of the distance, that it continued at least as far as one can run from danger, where two women had been washed up on a delay. Neither words nor the rigor of sentences, you said, could stem the steady acceleration of the past. As the streets were empty in the early morning, I had made the spaces between words broad enough for a smile which could reflect off the enamel tower clock. Being late is one of my essential properties. Unthinkable that I should not possess it, and not even on vacation do I deprive myself of its advantages. Nevertheless I cannot recall a time when I did not try to hide this by changing the shape of my mouth and appearing breathless. The sky was shading from hesitant to harsh, which was not bound to correspond to any one color or tableau vivant. The climate is rainy, no doubt about it, and ready to draw its curtain over my clauses and conjunctions. But what if I had made the spaces too wide to reach the next word and the silence. The fog was not dense enough to hide what I didn’t want to see, nor did analysis resolve our inner similarities. When you took the knife out of your pocket and stuck it into your upper arm you did not tell me that, if the laws of nature do not explain the world, they still continue its spine. There was no wind, the branches motionless around the bench, a dark scaffolding. A few drops of blood oozed from your wound. I began to suck it, thinking that, because language is part of the human organism, a life could end as an abrupt, violent sentence, or be drawn out with economy into fall and winter, no less complicated than a set of open parentheses from a wrong turn to the shock of understanding our own desires.","entry_meta":"(1987)","id":228},{"author":"CHARLES SIMIC","author_meta":"(1938–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Three Poems from The World Doesn’t End","text":"We were so poor I had to take the place of the bait in the mousetrap.

Women’s novels are about men too but from a different point of view. You can have a men’s novel with no women in it except possibly the landlady or the horse, but you can’t have a women’s novel with no men in it. Sometimes men put women in men’s novels but they leave out some of the parts, the heads, for instance, or the hands. Women’s novels leave out parts of the men as well. Sometimes it’s the stretch between the belly button and the knees, sometimes it’s the sense of humor. It’s hard to have a sense of humor in a cloak, in a high wind, on a moor. Women do not usually write novels of the type favored by men but men are known to write novels of the type favored by women. Some people find this odd. I like to read novels in which the heroine has a costume rustling discreetly over her breasts, or discreet breasts rustling under her costume; in any case there must be a costume, some breasts, some rustling, and, over all, discretion. Discretion over all, like a fog, a miasma through which the outlines of things appear only vaguely. A glimpse of pink through the gloom, the sound of breathing, satin slithering to the floor, revealing what? Never mind, I say. Never never mind. Men favor heroes who are tough and hard: tough with men, hard with women. Sometimes the hero goes soft on a woman but this is always a mistake. Women do not favor heroines who are tough and hard. Instead they have to be tough and soft. This leads to linguistic difficulties. Last time we looked, monosyllables were male, still dominant but sinking fast, wrapped in the octopoid arms of labial polysyllables, whispering to them with arachnoid grace: darling, darling. Men’s novels are about how to get power. Killing and so on, or winning and so on. So are women’s novels, though the method is different. In men’s novels, getting the woman or women goes along with getting the power. It’s a perk, not a means. In women’s novels you get the power by getting the man. The man is the power. But sex won’t do, he has to love you. What do you think all that kneeling’s about, down among the crinolines, on the Persian carpet? Or at least say it. When all else is lacking, verbalization can be enough. Love. There, you can stand up now, it didn’t kill you. Did it? I no longer want to read about anything sad. Anything violent, anything disturbing, anything like that. No funerals at the end, though there can be some in the middle. If there must be deaths, let there be resurrections, or at least a Heaven so we know where we are. Depression and squalor are for those under twenty-five, they can take it, they even like it, they still have enough time left. But real life is bad for you, hold it in your hand long enough and you’ll get pimples and become feeble-minded. You’ll go blind. I want happiness, guaranteed, joy all round, covers with nurses on them or brides, intelligent girls but not too intelligent, with regular teeth and pluck and both breasts the same size and no excess facial hair, someone you can depend on to know where the bandages are and to turn the hero, that potential rake and killer, into a well-groomed country gentleman with clean fingernails and the right vocabulary. Always, he has to say, Forever. I no longer want to read books that don’t end with the word forever. I want to be stroked between the eyes, one way only. Some people think a woman’s novel is anything without politics in it. Some think it’s anything about relationships. Some think it’s anything with a lot of operations in it, medical ones I mean. Some think it’s anything that doesn’t give you a broad panoramic view of our exciting times. Me, well, I just want something you can leave on the coffee table and not be too worried if the kids get into it. You think that’s not a real consideration? You’re wrong.

She had the startled eyes of a wild bird. Ah, but which one? A screech owl, perhaps, or a cuckoo? It does make a difference. We do not need more literalists of the imagination. They cannot read a body like a gazelle’s without thinking of intestinal parasites, zoos, and smells. She had a feral gaze like that of an untamed animal, I read. Reluctantly I put down the book, thumb still inserted at the exciting moment. He’s about to crush her in his arms, pressing his hot, devouring, hard, demanding mouth to hers as her breasts squish out the top of her dress, but I can’t concentrate. Metaphor leads me by the nose, into the maze, and suddenly all Eden lies before me. Porcupines, weasels, warthogs, and skunks, their feral gazes malicious or bland or stolid or piggy and sly. Agony, to see the romantic frisson quivering just out of reach, a dark-winged butterfly stuck to an overripe peach, and not to be able to swallow, or wallow. Which one?

I think of his sofas, stuffed to roundness, satin-covered, pale blue like the eyes of his cold blond unbodied murderous women, beating very slowly, like the hearts of hibernating crocodiles; of his chaises longues, with their malicious pillows. He knew about front lawns too, and greenhouses, and the interiors of cars. This is how our love affair would go. We would meet at a hotel, or a motel, whether expensive or cheap it wouldn’t matter. We would enter the room, lock the door, and begin to explore the furniture, fingering the curtains, running our hands along the spurious gilt frames of the pictures, over the real marble or the chipped enamel of the luxurious or tacky washroom sink, inhaling the odor of the carpets, old cigarette smoke and spilled gin and fast meaningless sex or else the rich abstract scent of the oval transparent soaps imported from England, it wouldn’t matter to us; what would matter would be our response to the furniture, and the furniture’s response to us. Only after we had sniffed, fingered, rubbed, rolled on, and absorbed the furniture of the room would we fall into each other’s arms, and onto the bed king-size? peach-colored? creaky? narrow? four-posted? pioneer-quilted? lime-green chenille-covered?, ready at last to do the same things to each other.","entry_meta":"(1992)","id":235},{"author":"FRANK BIDART","author_meta":"(1939–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Borges and I","text":"We fill pre-existing forms and when we fill them we change them and are changed. The desolating landscape in Borges Borges and I—in which the voice of I tells us that its other self, Borges, is the self who makes literature, who in the process of making literature falsifies and exaggerates, while the self that is speaking to us now must go on living so that Borges may continue to fashion literature—is seductive and even oddly comforting, but, I think, false. The voice of this I asserts a disparity between its essential self and its worldly second self, the self who seeks embodiment through making things, through work, who in making takes on something false, inessential, inauthentic. The voice of this I tells us that Spinoza understood that everything wishes to continue in its own being, a stone wishes to be a stone eternally, that all I wishes is to remain unchanged, itself. With its lonely emblematic title, Borges and I seems to be offered as a paradigm for the life of consciousness, the life of knowing and making, the life of the writer. The notion that Frank has a self that has remained the same and that knows what it would be if its writing self did not exist—like all assertions about the systems that hold sway beneath the moon, the opposite of this seems to me to be true, as true. When Borges I confesses that Borges falsifies and exaggerates it seems to do so to cast aside falsity and exaggeration, to attain an entire candor unobtainable by Borges. This I therefore allows us to enter an inaccessible magic space, a hitherto inarticulate space of intimacy and honesty earlier denied us, where voice, for the first time, has replaced silence. —Sweet fiction, in which bravado and despair beckon from a cold panache, in which the protected essential self suffers flashes of its existence to be immortalized by a writing self that is incapable of performing its actions without mixing our essence with what is false. Frank had the illusion, when he talked to himself in the cliches he used when he talked to himself, that when he made his poems he was changed in making them, that arriving at the order the poem suddenly arrived at out of the chaos of the materials the poem let enter itself out of the chaos of life, consciousness then, only then, could know itself, Sherlock Holmes was somebody or something before cracking its first case but not Sherlock Holmes, act is the cracked mirror not only of motive but self, no other way, tiny mirror that fails to focus in small the whole of the great room. But Frank had the illusion that his poems also had cruelly replaced his past, that finally they were all he knew of it though he knew they were not, everything else was shards refusing to make a pattern and in any case he had written about his mother and father until the poems saw as much as he saw and saw more and he only saw what he saw in the act of making them. He had never had a self that wished to continue in its own being, survival meant ceasing to be what its being was. Frank had the illusion that though the universe of one of his poems seemed so close to what seemed his own universe at the second of writing it that he wasn’t sure how they differed even though the paraphernalia often differed, after he had written it its universe was never exactly his universe, and so, soon, it disgusted him a little, the mirror was dirty and cracked. Secretly he was glad it was dirty and cracked, because after he had made a big order, a book, only when he had come to despise it a little, only after he had at last given up the illusion that this was what was, only then could he write more. He felt terror at the prospect of becoming again the person who could find or see or make no mirror, for even Olivier, trying to trap the beast who had killed his father, when he suavely told Frank as Frank listened to the phonograph long afternoons lying on the bed as a kid, when Olivier told him what art must be, even Olivier insisted that art is a mirror held up by an artist who himself needs to see something, held up before a nature that recoils before it. We fill pre-existing forms and when we fill them we change them and are changed. Everything in art is a formal question, so he tried to do it in prose with much blank white space.","entry_meta":"(1997)","id":236},{"author":"FANNY HOWE","author_meta":"(1940–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Everything’s a Fake","text":"Coyote scruff in canyons off Mulholland Drive.

Edith Stein, recently and controversially beatified by the Pope, who had successfully worked to transform an existential vocabulary into a theological one, was taken to Auschwitz in August, 1942. One year later Simone Weil died in a hospital in England—of illness and depression—determined to know what it is to know. She, as much as Woolf, sought salvation in a choice of words. But multitudes succumb to the sorrow induced by an inexact vocabulary. While a whole change in discourse is a sign of conversion, the alteration of a single word only signals a kind of doubt about the value of the surrounding words. Poets tend to hover over words in this troubled state of mind. What holds them poised in this position is the occasional eruption of happiness. While we would all like to know if the individual person is a phenomenon either culturally or spiritually conceived and why everyone doesn’t kill everyone else, including themselves, since they can—poets act out the problem with their words. Why not say heart-sick instead of despairing? Why not say despairing instead of depressed? Is there, perhaps, a quality in each person—hidden like a laugh inside a sob—that loves even more than it loves to live? If there is, can it be expressed in the form of the lyric line? Dostoevsky defended his later religious belief, saying of his work, Even in Europe there have never been atheistic expressions of such power. My hosannah has gone through a great furnace of doubt. According to certain friends, Simone Weil would have given everything she wrote to be a poet. It was an ideal but she was wary of charm and the inauthentic. She saw herself as stuck in fact with a rational prose line for her surgery on modern thought. She might be the archetypal doubter but the language of the lyric was perhaps too uncertain. As far as we know she wrote a play and some poems and one little prose poem called Prelude. Yet Weil could be called a poet, if Wittgenstein could, despite her own estimation of her writing, because of the longing for a transformative insight dominating her word choices. In Prelude the narrator is an uprooted seeker who still hopes that a conversion will come to her from the outside. The desired teacher arrives bearing the best of everything, including delicious wine and bread, affection, tolerance, solidarity people come and go and authority. This is a man who even has faith and loves truth. She is happy. Then suddenly, without any cause, he tells her it’s over. She is out on the streets without direction, without memory. Indeed she is unable to remember even what he told her without his presence there to repeat it, this amnesia being the ultimate dereliction. If memory fails, then the mind is air in a skull. This loss of memory forces her to abandon hope for either rescue or certainty. And now is the moment where doubt—as an active function—emerges and magnifies the world. It eliminates memory. And it turns eyesight so far outwards, the vision expands. A person feels as if she is the figure inside a mirror, looking outwards for her moves. She is a forgery. When all the structures granted by common agreement fall away and that reliable chain of cause and effect that Hannah Arendt talks about—breaks—then a person’s inner logic also collapses. She moves and sees at the same time, which is terrifying. Yet strangely it is in this moment that doubt shows itself to be the physical double to belief; it is the quality that nourishes willpower, and the one that is the invisible engine behind every step taken. Doubt is what allows a single gesture to have a heart. In this prose poem Weil’s narrator recovers her balance after a series of reactive revulsions to the surrounding culture by confessing to the most palpable human wish, that whoever he was, he loved her. Hope seems to resist extermination as much as a roach does. Hannah Arendt talks about the abyss of nothingness that opens up before any deed that cannot be accounted for. Consciousness of this abyss is the source of belief for most converts. Weil’s conviction that evil proves the existence of God is cut out of this consciousness. Her Terrible Prayer—that she be reduced to a paralyzed nobody—desires an obedience to that moment where coming and going intersect before annihilation. And her desire: To be only an intermediary between the blank page and the poem is a desire for a whole- heartedness that eliminates personality. Virginia Woolf, a maestro of lyric resistance, was frightened by Freud’s claustrophobic determinism since she had no ground of defense against it. The hideous vocabulary of mental science crushed her dazzling star-thoughts into powder and brought her latent despair into the open air. Born into a family devoted to skepticism and experiment, she had made a superhuman effort at creating a prose-world where doubt was a mesmerizing and glorious force. Anyone who tries, as she did, out of a systematic training in secularism, to forge a rhetoric of belief is fighting against the odds. Disappointments are everywhere waiting to catch you, and an ironic realism is so convincing. Simone Weil’s family was skeptical too, secular and attentive to the development of the mind. Her older brother fed her early sense of inferiority with his condescending intellectual putdowns. Later, her notebooks chart a superhuman effort at conversion to a belief in affliction as a sign of God’s presence. Her prose itself is tense with effort. After all, to convert by choice that is, without a blast of revelation or a personal disaster requires that you shift the names for things, and force a new language out of your mind onto the page. You have to make yourself believe. Is this possible? Can you turn void into God by switching the words over and over again? Any act of self-salvation is a problem because of death which always has the last laugh, and if there has been a dramatic and continual despair hanging over childhood, then it may even be impossible. After all, can you call doubt bewilderment and suddenly be relieved? Not if your mind has been fatally poisoned... But even then, it seems, the dream of having no doubt continues, finding its way into love and work where choices matter exactly as much as they don’t matter—when history’s things are working in your favor.","entry_meta":"(2000)","id":238},{"author":"TOM CLARK","author_meta":"(1941–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Death, Revenge and the Profit Motive","text":"Death is good, revenge is a waste of time, and who ever thought up the profit motive didn’t understand either of those things, John said, tipping his head back to pour another drink into it.

One night, walking back from a concert, they came to her door and she turned to him and said, I think you would like to have me. I would like that too, but I must tell you that I have had a double mastectomy, and when he didn’t understand, I’ve lost both my breasts. The radiance that he had carried around in his belly and chest cavity—like music—withered very quickly, and he made himself look at her when he said, I’m sorry. I don’t think I could. He walked back to his own cabin through the pines, and in the morning he found a small blue bowl on the porch outside his door. It looked to be full of rose petals, but he found when he picked it up that the rose petals were on top; the rest of the bowl—she must have swept them from the corners of her studio—was full of dead bees.","entry_meta":"(1989)","id":240},{"author":"ROBERT HASS","author_meta":"(1941–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"In the Bahamas","text":"The doctor looked at her stitches thoughtfully.

The desire to sleep was light bulbs dimming as a powerful appliance kicks on. You recognized that. As in school it was explained to you that pus was a brave army of white corpuscles hurling themselves at the virulent invader and dying. Riding through the Netherlands on a train, you noticed that even the junk was neatly stacked in the junkyards. There were magpies in the fields beside the watery canals, neat little houses, tall windows. In Leiden, on the street outside the university, the house where Descartes lived was mirrored in the canal. There was a pair of swans and a sense that, without haste or anxiety, all the people on the street were going to arrive at their appointments punctually. Swans and mirrors. And Descartes. It was easy to see how this European tranquillity would produce a poet like Mallarmé, a middle-class art like symbolism. And you did not despise the collective orderliness, the way the clerks in the stores were careful to put bills in the cash register with the Queen’s face facing upward. In the house next to the house where Descartes lived, a Jewish professor died in His wife was a Dutch woman of strict Calvinist principles and she was left with two sons. When the Nazis came in 1940, she went to court and perjured herself by testifying that her children were conceived during an illicit affair with a Gentile, and when she developed tuberculosis in 1943, she traded passports with a Jewish friend, since she was going to die anyway, and took her place on the train to the camps. Her sons kissed her good-bye on the platform. Eyes open.

I say that as much to comfort myself as to state something I think to be true. Dashing up out of the dark basement, pursued by the humid fear. Similarly, due to some peculiar sentimentality, people always want the runt of the litter. She sat every afternoon in her chair waiting for her headache, exactly as one might sit on a bench awaiting a bus. In a book I read the sentence, the water is as blue as ink, which made me regret that so few people use fountain pens. Never give the blindman money without taking one of his pencils. When I went to Christian Science Sunday school, the teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I answered that I wanted to be a writer or a doctor. The words of the last one to speak continued to hover in the air, and that was embarrassing. A name trimmed with colored ribbons. At the circus men were selling live chameleons which wore tiny collars and were attached to red and yellow ribbons that one could pin to one’s dress or shirt as a living jewel. As for we who love to be astonished, mother love. The game of solitaire, of patience, is disappointing when it comes out the first time. It is impossible to return to the state of mind in which these sentences originated. So I borrowed my father’s typewriter. There was a garden, a hole in the fence, a grandfather who had no religion—one can run through the holes in memory, wearing a wet hat, onto the sidewalk covered with puddles, and there are fingers in them. Similarly, a beautiful concert or an unusual autumn sunset makes me feel restless if I’m by myself, wanting someone with whom to share it. At noon, under no one’s new moon. I didn’t want the kids over to play, messing with my stuff. We were coughing after a day by the sea. That was the gap between behavior and feeling. This was a year at the breaking point, turning over, given the swift combination. That summer when I was nine I trained myself to hold my breath and stubbornly swim the full length of the pool under water and back, until the returning end of the pool went black. In the telephone room one heard the disembodied voice over the receiver while staring into the row of empty coats and hats, and when we played hide and seek with the other cousins, on those occasions when my grandparents had all the family to dinner, only the oldest cousins dared hide among them. An other is a possibility, isn’t it. I have been spoiled with privacy, permitted the luxury of solitude. A pause, a rose, something on paper. I didn’t want a party for my tenth birthday, I wanted my mother, who was there, of course, at the party, but from whom I was separated by my friends and because she was busy with the cake and the balloons. She kept a diary but she never read it. Yet those who scorn friendship can, without illusion but not without some remorse, be the finest friends in the world. Now the shower curtain is sexy. The gap indicated that objects or events had been forgotten, that a place was being held for them, should they chance to reappear. The sound of the truck had frightened the towhees away. Like the big, round O taught by the traditional penmanship teachers the Palmer method, it was called, there was a big round A and we were to pronounce it, in place of the nasty, narrow A in words like cat and Ann. The high curb turned on the curve. The windows on the northwestern wall looked out toward the clock on the so-called Campanile by which my father, far-sighted, kept time. What was the meaning hung from that depend. Apples have bellies. She was a skinny little girl and her bathing suit fit her so loosely that when she sat to play on the beach the sand fell into the crotch and filled it like a little pouch. The toll bridge takes its toll, the span its fog, its paint. Nevertheless fleas, and therefore powders. You are not different from your friend, but with your friend you are different from yourself, and recognizing that, I withdrew, wanting to protect my honesty, because I had defined integrity on two dimensions. I pushed my thumb to make a lever of the blunt spoon, he took up the palette knife and ships came out of the blue, I hit the space bar. Actually I don’t remember whether my father went with Braque or was only invited to do so one fine day outside of Paris to paint a landscape in plain air. And finally, on a visit to the zoo, as we were passing by the enclosure where the silver foxes were kept, I saw a flock of sparrows pecking at the ground of the enclosure, and one of them, venturing too close to a fox which was crouching in the shadow of an artificial rock, was suddenly seized by the fox, who swallowed it in a moment. I wrote my name in every one of his books It was awhile before I understood what had come between the stars, to form the constellations. They were at a restaurant owned by Danes. Now that I was old enough to make my own decisions, I dressed like everyone else. People must flatter their own eyes with their pathetic lives. The things I was saying followed logically the things that I had said before, yet they bore no relation to what I was thinking and feeling. There was once a crooked man, who rode a crooked mile—thereafter he wrote in a crooked style characteristic of 19th-century prose, a prose of science with cumulative sentences. The ideal was of American property and she had received it from a farmer. It includes buying thrillers and gunmen’s coats. I was more terrified of the FBI agents than of the unspecified man who had kidnapped, murdered, and buried the girl in the other fifth grade in the hill behind school. A pause, a rose, something on paper. It was at about this time that my father provided me with every right phrase about the beauty and wonder of books. Colored cattle were grazing on a California hillside, so much of a single yellow that from this distance and at this hour it was impossible to see any gradation of light and shadow. Individuality is animated by its sense of the infinite. I play a sentimental role. The debater makes his point, and in games, points tell the winner. These one suddenly finds childish, embarrassing, but not yet dull. Fallow power, bright red and yellow. We say thought wanders where it should sweep. As for we who love to be astonished, she pretends she is a blacksmith. In the hot lot beside the tire dealer a crew of two eats lunch. There is always plenty to do until one is bored, and then the boredom itself generates the lack, generates its own necessary conditions. The supernatural makes it cry. Now she’s a violinist. What is certain, at least, is that one must avoid dishonest work. I quote my mother’s mother’s mother’s mother’s mother, I must every day correct some fault in my morality or talents and remember how short a time I have to live. You might say she created her reality simply because she would not have it, any other way. It is hard to turn away from moving water. She suggested we take a nice nap. Even when I was too old for the pony rides at the park, I loved the little creatures, and I watched my younger sister clinging to the saddle horn as the ponies plodded around the narrow circle, feeling superior, since on Saturdays I took riding lessons on real horses, and yet envious, too, since it was not Saturday and it was my sister and not I who was riding now. You are so generous, they told me, allowing everything its place, but what we wanted to hear was a story. A blare of sound, a roar of life, a vast array of human hives, reveling in education. What a situation. Whenever you’ve exhausted setting, topic, or tone, begin a new paragraph. The refrigerator makes a sound I can’t spell. The finches have come at last to the feeder. The magician had come to entertain the children at the birthday party. It was called mush, and we ate it for breakfast in patterns, like pudding. We were like plump birds along the shore. Green night divining trees, scooped too. What memory is not a gripping thought. But it’s a happy song. It took all day. He had stolen a tin of nuts and given them to me and now I had to return them to the store, like a thief returning to the shelf, but I managed to pull it off and put them back. The romance of the vanished. I had begun to learn, from the experience of passionate generosity, about love. Yet we insist that life is full of happy chance The windows were open and the morning air was, by the smell of lilac and some darker flowering shrub, filled with the brown and chirping trills of birds. As they are if you could have nothing but quiet and shouting. Arts, also, are links. I picture an idea at the moment I come to it, our collision. Once, for a time, anyone might have been luck’s child. Even rain didn’t spoil the barbecue, in the backyard behind a polished traffic, through a landscape, along a shore. Freedom then, liberation later. She came to babysit for us in those troubled years directly from the riots, and she said that she dreamed of the day when she would gun down everyone in the financial district. That single telephone is only one hair on the brontosaurus. The coffee drinkers answered ecstatically. If your dog stays out of the room, you get the fleas. In the lull, activity drops. I’m seldom in my dreams without my children. My daughter told me that at some time in school she had learned to think of a poet as a person seated on an iceberg and melting through it. It is a poetry of certainty. In the distance, down the street, the practicing soprano belts the breeze. As for we who love to be astonished, money makes money, luck makes luck. Moves forward, drives on. Class background is not landscape—still here and there in 1969 I could feel the scope of collectivity. It was the present time for a little while, and not so new as we thought then, the present always after war. Ever since it has been hard for me to share my time. The yellow of that sad room was again the yellow of naps, where she waited, restless, faithless, for more days. They say that the alternative for the bourgeoisie was gullibility. Call it water and dogs. Reason looks for two, then arranges it from there. But can one imagine a madman in love. Goodbye; enough that was good. There was a pause, a rose, something on paper. I may balk but I won’t recede. Because desire is always embarrassing. At the beach, with a fresh flush. The child looks out. The berries are kept in the brambles, on wires on reserve for the birds. At a distance, the sun is small. There was no proper Christmas after he died. That triumphant blizzard had brought the city to its knees. I am a stranger to the little girl I was, and more—more strange. But many facts about a life should be left out, they are easily replaced. One sits in a cloven space. Patterns promote an outward likeness, between little white silences. The big trees catch all the moisture from what seems like a dry night. Reflections don’t make shade, but shadows are, and do. In order to understand the nature of the collision, one must know something of the nature of the motions involved—that is, a history. He looked at me and smiled and did not look away, and thus a friendship became erotic. Luck was rid of its clover.","entry_meta":"(1987)","id":243},{"author":"JOE BRAINARD","author_meta":"(1942–1994)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Freud","text":"From Freud we learn that when a wife smashes a vase to the floor it is really her husband’s head that lies there broken into many pieces.","id":244},{"author":"JOE BRAINARD","author_meta":"(1942–1994)","title":"History","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","text":"With history piling up so fast, almost every day is the anniversary of something awful.","entry_meta":"(1974)","id":245},{"author":"LOUIS JENKINS","author_meta":"(1942–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Football","text":"I take the snap from center, fake to the right, fade back...

I sit outside, or inside by the window, and look out, and for a moment I realize my left hand is holding up my head. I see the light on everything, trees, hills, and clouds, and I do not see the trees, hills, and clouds. I see the light, and it plays over my mind that it is any day, not today, just day. The wind is making the trees swoosh and the volume goes up and down. I have been sitting here for some time, at first looking out at the grass and trees and sky, and then, turning more and more into my mind and its noticing things, gradually looking at nothing of what was before my eyes. A great cutting slash arced across the last turn of the mental pathway I had wandered down and up, and was approaching me from the left. I cocked my head to that left. Slash, slash in the woods. My legs chilled. I will wait until I hear it once more, then I will get up and go inside. In times of trouble and despondency I turn to sportswear. I have just added to my wardrobe three pairs of pastel-colored shorts and four light-gray T-shirts and a yellow cotton pullover so elegant and offhand it must have been designed in France. I put on my new clothes, lace up my new white shoes, and see people. They say, You look nice. Are those shorts new? Yes, they are, I answer. Then I go back home and sit on the porch under the sky in my new shorts. I look at you sometimes when you’re not aware of it. I look at you in those moments the way a stranger might so I can see you better than I usually do. And in fact you do always look fresh and new and similar to the person I think of as you. I love the way you look. And I feel happy just to be here looking at you, the way the dog sits at the feet of us, his great gods. I sit at the feet of the thing that is you. I look at your feet. I take off my clothes and am in the air, me flowing through it and it flowing around me. I look to the right. The first cottages of the little village, the first houses of the town, the first buildings of the city, bones, flesh, and clothing. Air around it all. Air I cannot breathe, because I am also a structure I am moving past, a tomb, a monument, a big nothing. He is a man of many vectors, that assemble and reassemble, the way music comes first from the air, then from a piece of wood grown in air. Then the air is in a museum in a country you are not permitted to enter at this time because your vectors are not in order. You must go home and reassemble your rods and cones: night is falling, the soft gray mist of his breath. I dreamed I had become a tall hamburger piloting a plane going down in a remote jungle waving up at me with inexpensive green cardboard natives ecstatic at the arrival, at last, of their messiah. A radiant hamburger bun top opened above me as I floated softly into their gyrating angular green midst. I come to a mental clearing where I can speak only from the heart. Free of the baggage of who I happen to be, and of all the porters who must carry the baggage, and the exorbitant taxi ride into a fuller version of the same small personality, I take, for what seems to be the first time in a long time, a breath that goes deeper than the bottom of the lungs, and in the pause that comes at the end of that breath there appears a little mirror, light fog on it clearing quickly. The palm of my hand is in Sunday, groggy, sabbatical. The rest of me is in Wednesday, up there and to the left, in the sky. I see you need a light, though you have nothing to smoke. You left your smoking utensils in Thursday. Let me recall my hand and fetch them for you. There, now you are creating puffs. But they do not dissipate. They form shadow copies of my hand that is moving toward your face. It dawns on me that I’m repeating myself. Another day and there I am, calm outside in the air with my hand returning along its vectors. In this mental clearing the photons are jumping all around the savages. Suddenly the witch doctor brings his face to mine and shouts, Mgwabi. Mgwabi! pointing to my photons. I reach up and take the light from his face and fold it with the fingers on my hands and it dawns on me that I’m repeating myself. At the end of the light I raise my voice from down there to up here and you are not here. I could shout until the words change colors and it would make no difference. Your vectors are heading out away from the voice of my hand and toward what it is pointing to, that bright cloud over there, the one with the burning edges, handsome and lighter than air at last. A cold streak runs through the sky now the color of wet cement that forms the body of the man whose brain is at a height of more miles than can be found on earth. This emotional absolute zero is like a spine conducting thick fog and thin rain through him, and when the sun’s vectors approach his surface they turn and move parallel to it. Who is this big cement man? And how do I know whether or not he is the same who came this morning and threw on the power that sent the electricity branching through my heart? It’s dark today. I sit inside, my right hand touching my head. I look at the floor, the fabrics, the smoke from my mouth. It’s as if there isn’t any light, as if part of things being here is what light they have inseparable from themselves, not visible. The table doesn’t stand for anything, although it remembers the tree. The table isn’t immortal, though it hums a tune of going on forever. The table is in Friday, with me, both of us here in this dark, miserable day, and I have the feeling I’m smiling, though I’m not.","entry_meta":"(1988)","id":249},{"author":"RON PADGETT","author_meta":"(1942–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Album","text":"The mental pictures I have of my parents and grandparents and my childhood are beginning to break up into small fragments and get blown away from me into empty space, and the same wind is sucking me toward it ever so gently, so gently as not even to raise a hair on my head though the truth is that there are very few of them to be raised.

And when he lost in this game of confidence, he laughed uproariously, as though to say, I knew it. He was well into his fourth quart of vodka. He had been drinking for three days. There was definitely something peaceful about it. Clean, neat, clear. The ice-machine couldn’t keep up. To hell with it. He had stopped staggering and was no longer tired. He felt as though he were watching himself on the tube, the skeleton of the story shown through like a timeless Late Movie. The humanity of it overwhelmed him! How he wished to throw his lot in with the pack, a headlong sacrifice! He had thought until now that he was somehow on a stalk, he was the favored jester’s tool, comic and frightening, but still the only one of its kind. He could still call Roberta; she had given him a second chance before. She seemed to see beyond his fluctuations, his flips and twitches. She knew him before he was born. She had been there all along. Of course the call wouldn’t do much good if she knew he was drunk. But he wasn’t, not now. Now he saw how they served interlocking fates. She would come back, as always. She would forgive him. They could make it work. They had always said that. Billy balanced himself against the wall and the table as he made his way toward the kitchen phone. He grabbed for the phone. He lunged and stabbed at it. It was empty air in his hand. Not this time, Billy, her voice said. Billy stared at the evasive phone. His legs crumbled beneath him until he lay like an unpropped dummy against the counter. There’s got to be more than this, he slobbered. Now he was drooling all over himself, imitating a bum he had once stumbled over in the Bowery. And then he laughed, remembering the sign the bum had tied around his neck: The Second Greatest Story Ever Told, and in pencil below: 5¢.

That was his hat for show. I am thinking of his private bathing cap, which in all honesty wasn’t much different than the one any jerk might buy at a corner drugstore now, except for two minor eccentricities. The first one isn’t even funny, Simply it was a white rubber bathing cap, but too small. Napoleon led such a hectic life ever since his childhood, even farther back than that, that he never had a chance to buy a new bathing cap and still as a grown-up—well, he didn’t really grow that much, but his head did: He was a pinhead at birth, and he used, until his death really, the same little tiny bathing cap that he was born in, and this meant that later it was very painful to him and gave him many headaches, as if he needed more. So, he had to vaseline his skull like crazy to even get the thing on. The second eccentricity was that it was a tricorn bathing cap. Scholars like to make a lot out of this, and it would be easy to do. My theory is simple-minded to be sure: that beneath his public head there was another head and it was a pyramid or something.","entry_meta":"(1986)","id":254},{"author":"JAMES TATE","author_meta":"(1943–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Distance from Loved Ones","text":"After her husband died, Zita decided to get the face-lift she had always wanted.

Our plan is to just do everything ourselves without any babysitters for the next two weeks and then the classes are over, then we’ll go to New York for a while again, the midwife said I had a neat uterus and she could feel whole arms and legs of the baby, I was waking and talking to a woman on the phone the other day about a playgroup and she kept using the word shoot, kept saying, Shoot I would do anything and Shoot I understand what you mean, yes shoot, then we’ll come back here and spend January getting ready to have the baby, then the baby will be born at the end of that month, I can’t find Dr. Spock can you? but before that we have to gather together all the things we need for the birth and for the baby, cotton balls and undershirts and roasted towels and a bureau for the baby’s clothes and Marie needs a new coat, and we have to do some laundry sometime, when she plays outside now and squats to dig in the dirt the skin of her back is exposed to the air, and they both need new tights, there isn’t any snow on the ground yet, it’s easy to rely on the beat Poets when you’re teaching, any more abstract stuff often turns the students off, they find Frank O’Hara much too difficult, I also want alot of red velvet material and a big red rug to induce feelings that can go past the moon, it’s full again today, those regressive souls in my classes keep talking about how LSD makes deformed babies, these matches are called Rosebud because they have red tips of fire, so many times when you’re pregnant people can’t help but tell you all the worst stories they ever heard, I miss the part of Main Street in Lenox right in front of the bank where the crosswalk led across to the entrance to the library and the buses and cars came circling around the obelisk, Henniker’s equivalent of an obelisk is a kind of former fountain on a triangular island at the foot of which is always lying an old apple core and a discarded ribbon, when I look up I see a portrait of a man holding a glove, if Russell doesn’t see us at all tomorrow perhaps he’ll think we’re not there, I have only twenty minutes left if I’m going to get any sleep, what can I give you, is writing this offering? Lying in bed is a turmoil, anything can enter in, early tomorrow a woman will come with some children, she will be able to explain things to me about this town, she teaches cross-country skiing, now why don’t I do something like that instead of wondering only about babies, poetry, the city, the country and the wisdom I was trying to talk to you about, yet I must’ve sounded a little corrupt when I said that. I do wonder also about you and your way of slumping in a chair which confounds your other way of looking like a jogger in pajamas, I shouldn’t mention pajamas or everyone will make fun of me, I’m sort of looking forward to this January of heavy snows and waiting, bitter cold and never parting again for a while. I don’t like teaching, it distracts us, it’s like everything else everybody says is healthy, skiing jogging and sitting up straight and being independent, eating seaweed and living in the country, the protean brain, or the other way around, Montherlant is nothing if not protean. A peninsula is a body of land almost completely surrounded by water. Some old people live on one can of soup a day. A little peach in the orchard grew, a little peach of emerald hue... I was reading this novel about a man who burned his girlfriend’s house down and then later was almost completely the cause of her father’s death and they try to make a case for this rogue being rather an expression of the girl’s own destructive instincts so the book winds up without a sense of humor ENDLESS LOVE and so am I, it’s better to go back to NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND for that. More subtle like the weather’s blatancy does that mean wind?. But I’m sure you never asked me for my opinions, you asked me for something of beauty, like the idea of the constructing of a house, something less than esoteric, something formal that also has a use, a wedding song or a description of some semi-precious stones. How am I supposed to fit into this life where children eat so much expensive fruit and leave their trucks in the sand to be run over by the diaper man, will the fleshy inflorescence of a collection of color photographs still look like a pineapple or pine cone or a small bomb that looks like one of those? You and I like having each other to ourselves, I compare the two hands of the two yous but I still can’t tell if the hurt one is swollen, why do we have so many injuries lately, is it wrong to walk into a door or let windows slam on your hands, to be slightly stabbed by the midwife to determine the iron content... Something shifts and as Wittgenstein would say, and anybody else not normal, to take some pleasure in being obsessively careful, to quietly comb out the baby’s hair and take one’s time, to decorate the children with ribbons and whisper to them, to prepare special foods, secret inducements, to linger conversing about the dreams in bed, to encourage the counting of peanuts, these are the methods of the usual, inducements to the ordinary, to pass the time, to adduce pleasure, to encounter danger, to see silver spots before the eyes without fear, the safest form within which to take risks, the advertisement of the day’s misery if I can still look up and see the man with the glove and a chance image of the accumulation of objects, the storehouse of pictures which will not work out in memory, there’s only one time when you can’t be doing this or that kind of work and have something like a drink make it easier than it is, and that’s when you’re giving birth to a baby but there’s nothing new about that. I wish I could try it as a man for once and be the one watching nervously instead of the inhabitant of this always female body, always momentarily fertile and prone to that if I can use that word, it’s worse than taking LSD, not over till it’s over, hoping the baby will be born before another child wakes up, warning people that your screams are not real screams like in a movie or book, expressions of the forward movement of time or movements of the forward expression of time like words, in that case scream is to lean forward and make the time pass faster, hours by clocks in what they still call labor, different from plain work, working in contractions of the muscles of the... and so on, you know all about it I’m sure, lucidly there’s space in between during which you feel like yourself again and that is like the book, then when the baby is finally born you don’t know for a moment if you’re thinking of yourself or the other, there’s no reason why the words other and mother ought like an otter to rhyme, they didn’t in Middle English, but then you wouldn’t want to know the derivations for mother, the lees or dregs, I won’t go into that, which is why it’s difficult to remember to immediately hold the baby, you don’t know the baby is different from you, especially if someone else is there. I had a baby once drawn out by forceps from my unwitting unconscious body and when I woke up I said, what was it. It’s worth the tedious trip of consciousness with all the unnecessary pains to thus conquer nature with memory’s astuteness, it’s like the perception of color in after images.

In the background, smoke from the factories and smoke from the steamboats merge into tiny clouds above us, then disappears. Our mothers and fathers walk arm in arm along the shore clutching tightly their umbrellas and canes. We are sitting on a blanket in the foreground, but even if someone were to take a photograph, only our closest relatives would recognize us, we seem to be burying our heads between our knees.

They said, The horse must die. My brother-in-law liked horses and sure didn’t want to shoot one. But what could he do? The people who said The horse must die were rich and powerful. They owned many things—the horse for one. What they said went. If they said to you Go fuck yourself, you did. If they said Beat it, you beat it. If they said Eat shit, you had to eat shit. You had to do what they told you. They said to him, The horse must die. Shoot the horse. So my brother-in-law got his gun. Once I was in the woods with my brother-in-law. It was in the middle of winter and we both wore snow-shoes. We came to a stream deep in the woods and he told me that he had to go check something and that I should wait for him. I said okay. He left and I waited about an hour and a half for him to come back. I was afraid to move since I figured that I’d get lost. I was sure that I would be attacked by bats, snakes, bears, whatever might live in the woods. But finally he came back before anything had a chance to attack me. Another time he gave me a rifle to carry in case we might meet up with any bobcats. There was a bounty on bobcats at that time which meant that if you shot one, you could collect some money. But he sure didn’t want to shoot the horse. He just had to shoot it because they told him to. So he got his gun and walked over to the stable. An Oriental gentleman took care of the horse. My brother-in-law walked right up to the Oriental gentleman and said, I come to shoot this horse. The Oriental gentleman asked, Why? My brother-in-law said, Because they told me to. So the Oriental gentleman brought the horse out of the stable for my brother-in-law to shoot. It was a real nice day, the day my brother-in-law shot the horse. The sun was shining and the green mountains looked very pretty. The horse was quite handsome and popular. The Oriental gentleman started to cry. The horse looked at my brother-in-law. But my brother-in-law looked right back at him. He said to the horse, I come to shoot you dead, and he lifted his gun, took aim, and shot the horse in the neck. But the horse took off, heading for the woods. Blood was spouting from his neck. My brother-in-law took off after him. Soon they were in the woods and the blood from the horse’s neck was gushing out all over the trees. My brother-in-law shot the horse in the ass and the horse started to bleed from the ass too. But he kept running with my brother-in-law chasing him. My brother-in-law kept after him, but he was getting tired. He didn’t know how the horse could have so much blood inside him. He got very angry at the horse. He yelled to the horse, I’ll kill you, you sorry son of a bitch and I’ll blow your stupid fucking head off, you sorry son of a bitch. The ordeal was very frustrating for my brother-in-law. My brother-in-law was covered with horse blood. He had been chasing the horse for about twenty minutes, but the horse kept going. It seemed like there was rich red horse blood splattered all over the woods. My brother-in-law knew that he wouldn’t be able to chase the horse much longer. The horse wasn’t going too fast, but he just never stopped long enough for my brother-in-law to get a good shot off into his brain. Finally, my brother-in-law collapsed and the horse kept going. He lay on the ground for a minute, soaked with warm horse blood, and when he looked up again, there was no sign of the horse, except for the trail of horse blood. My brother-in-law got up and said, You fucking sorry son of a bitch. What would he tell the people who had said to him The horse must die? My brother-in-law staggered back to the stable where he had first shot the horse in the neck. The Oriental gentleman was there and was still crying. When he saw how my brother-in-law was drenched in blood, he became terribly frightened. My brother-in-law was so angry and frustrated that he shot the Oriental gentleman in the face. As he shot him, he said, You sorry son of a bitch. The Oriental gentleman’s hands flung up to his face when he got shot, but there was nothing there but bloody mush and he was dead already anyway. The people who told him to shoot the horse were very understanding when my brother-in-law explained what had happened. Those things happen, they said.","entry_meta":"(1975)","id":263},{"author":"B.J.

So they built the ship Platonic to warn us not to screw; what it had to do with Plato, we didn’t have a clue. Poor Plato, alas, lamented the incapacity of chairs to approach the ideal of chairness; no chair, however hard it might try, could ever achieve in his eyes the beauty of that naked, unmediated state. Poor Plato, obsessed with chairs. No wonder she and her girlfriends had wondered why abstinence was called Platonic or, more precisely, why it meant not-fucking, since if they’d run into the word at all it would have been somebody’s uncle in AA, and who ever talked about that back then; and finally, when they got to philosophy in school, how the hell Platonic got conjured from Plato, a man who had once lived and breathed and jerked himself off, they supposed, against the backs of chairs in various states of imperfection—rocky, rickety, rocking—the doctor in the deep blue sea only knew. Poor Plato, lured off his true and proper course, fetched up on a floating slagheap of sophistry, hoisted on a pinnacle of pieties arch and brittle as ice. O they built the ship Platonic to warn us not to screw, and they thought we’d get on board and enjoy the frigid view. Were they wrong. Young girls and boys saw right through their parents ploys, husbands and wives had to reassess their lives. Was it sad? no doubt, o so sad, she thought as she eyed the guy at the next table over and watched that clone of her first serious boyfriend lean back in his chair so it squealed and moaned under his weight, so its legs thrust up to reveal at once the fragility and force of the attachment, the dazzling impermanence of the greater whole—a form which surpassed, in its corporeal perfection, any ideal to which it might have sought or been forbidden to aspire. O spire, o pinnacle of pieties erupting on the sweet breath of night, plunging into the dark, fragrant, teeming, blooming sea.

Someone was reading a poem by Auden there, every long line of it like the technical name of a newly instituted disease, but though the square was vibrant in the chickenshit rain that caulked the bricks with light and the hominid ants upstanding like chesspieces slid quietly toward a decent autism in old auditoriums in still worse places there was unlikely and banal torture, activity furious at not being action. Omnia migrant, one ant said. Apocussion.

Neither the symbols nor the negotiations saved us. Rescued not saved. He died there: migratory nonmessiah. To remain slaves we invented the idea of a messiah. The mistake: there are no translations; no messiahs, symbols of negotiation; only the empty negotiations themselves.

The parts of their bodies which had been covered by clothes were those of leopards. During puberty her own organs and skin were not like this though when she first had intercourse with a man he removed his clothes and his organ and flesh were also a leopard’s. She already felt pleasure in sexual activity and her body not resembling these adults made her come easily which also occurred when she had intercourse with another man a few months later. When sexual unions occurred between a brother and sister they weren’t savages or primitive. She had that feeling about having intercourse with men whose organs were those of leopards and hers were not. Walking somewhere after one of these episodes she was excited by it though she might not have made this comparison if she’d actually had a brother. At least the woman she had seen in the shower had a leopard’s parts. In these episodes when she’d had intercourse with a man he didn’t remark about her not being like that. And if women had these characteristics which she didn’t it made her come more easily with him. She overheard another couple together and happened to see them as she had the couple in the shower. The nude part of the woman was like herself and the man had the leopard’s parts so that she had the same reaction and came easily with someone, as she had with a sense of other women having a leopard’s traits and herself isolated. The man with whom she had intercourse did not say anything that showed he had seen a difference in her and that made her react physically. Yet other women seemed to have a leopard’s characteristics except for this one she’d seen. Again it seemed that a man with whom she had intercourse was her brother and was ardent with her—but this would not have occurred to her had she really had a brother. Yet her feeling about him was also related to her seeing a woman who was pregnant and was the only one to be so. The woman not receiving attention or remarks on the pregnancy excited her; and went together with her sense of herself coming easily and yet not being pregnant until quite awhile after this time. She also felt that she came easily feeling herself isolated when she was pregnant since she had the sense of other women having leopards organs. They had previously had children. She was the only one who was pregnant and again she saw a couple together, the man with leopard’s parts and the woman not having these characteristics. Again she could come since her body was different from the adult who had some parts that were leopards’, and having the sense of the women having had children earlier than her and their not having younger children now. Her liking the other women to have had children when she was pregnant had to do with having them there and herself isolated—and yet people not saying much about or responding to the pregnancy. She thought of the man coming as when she caught a sight of the couple together—being able to come with someone a different time because she had a sense of a woman she’d seen having had her children earlier. There being a difference of age, even ten years, between a child she’d have and those the other women had had. She happened to see some men who were undressed, as if they were boys—one of them had the features and organ of a leopard and the others did not. The difference in this case gave her the sense of them being boys, all of them rather than those who didn’t have leopards characteristics and this made her come easily with someone. It was not a feeling of their being a younger age, since the men were her own age, and she found the men who lacked the leopard features to be as attractive as the one who had those features. She had the feeling of them as adults and her the same age as them, yet had the other feeling as well in order for her to come then. She saw a couple who were entwined together and her feeling about them came from the earlier episode of seeing the men who were nude and having the sense of them being adolescent boys. Really she’d had the sense of the men she’d seen as being adults and herself the same age as them. The couple she watched were also around the same age as herself—the man being aware of someone else’s presence after a time and coming. The woman pleased then though she had not come. She had intercourse with the man who had the features and organs of a leopard and whom she had first seen with the group of men who lacked these characteristics. The other men were attractive as he was. Yet having the sense of the difference between him and the others, she found it pleasant for him to come and for her not to come that time. The same thing occurred on another occasion with him. She compared the man to plants, to the plants having a nervous aspect and being motionless. The man coming when he had the sense of being delayed in leaving—as if being slowed down had made him come and was exciting, and it was during the afternoon with people walking around. He was late and had to go somewhere, and came, with a feeling of delay and retarding—rather than out of nervousness.","entry_meta":"(1985)","id":281},{"author":"TOM WHALEN","author_meta":"(1948–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Why I Hate the Prose Poem","text":"An angry man came into the kitchen where his wife was busying herself about supper and exploded.

This is what it feels like to be a huge typewriter in a dress. Yes, I feel we have gotten inside gertrude stein, and of course it is dark inside the enormous gertrude, it is like being locked up in a refrigerator lit only by a smiling rind of cheese. Being inside gertrude is like being inside a monument made of a cloud which is always moving across the sky which is also always moving. Gertrude is a huge galleon of cloud anchored to the ground by one small tether, yes, I see it down there, do you see that tiny snail glued to the tackboard of the landscape¿ That is alice. So, I am inside gertrude; we belong to each other, she and I, and it is so wonderful because I have always been a thin woman inside of whom a big woman is screaming to get out, and she’s out now and if a river could type this is how it would sound, pure and complicated and enormous. Now we are lilting across the countryside, and we are talking, and if the wind could type it would sound like this, ongoing and repetitious, abstracting and stylizing everything, like our famous haircut painted by Picasso. Because when you are inside our haircut you understand that all the flotsam and jetsam of hairdo have been cleared away like the forests from the New World so that the skull can show through grinning and feasting on the alarm it has created. I am now, alarmingly, inside gertrude’s head and I am thinking that I may only be a thought she has had when she imagined that she and alice were dead and gone and someone had to carry on the work of being gertrude stein, and so I am receiving, from beyond the grave, radioactive isotopes of her genius saying, take up my work, become gertrude stein. Because someone must be gertrude stein, someone must save us from the literalists and realists, and narratives of the beginning and end, someone must be a river that can type. And why not I¿ Gertrude is insisting on the fact that while I am a subgenius, weighing one hundred five pounds, and living in a small town with an enormous furry male husband who is always in his Cadillac Eldorado driving off to sell something to people who do not deserve the bad luck of this merchandise in their lives—that these facts would not be a problem for gertrude stein. Gertrude and I feel that, for instance, in Patriarchal Poetry when like an avalanche that can type she is burying the patriarchy, still there persists a sense of condescending affection. So, while I’m a thin, heterosexual subgenius, nevertheless gertrude has chosen me as her tool, just as she chose the patriarchy as a tool for ending the patriarchy. And because I have become her tool, now, in a sense, gertrude is inside me. It’s tough. Having gertrude inside me is like having swallowed an ocean liner that can type, and, while I feel like a very small coat closet with a bear in it, gertrude and I feel that I must tell you that gertrude does not care. She is using me to get her message across, to say, I am lost, I am beset by literalists and narratives of the beginning and middle and end, help me. And so, yes, I say, yes, I am here, gertrude, because we feel, gertrude and I, that there is real urgency in our voice like a sob that can type and that things are very bad for her because she is lost, beset by the literalists and realists, her own enormousness crushing her, and we must find her and take her into ourselves, even though I am the least likely of saviors and have been chosen perhaps as a last resort, yes, definitely, gertrude is saying to me, you are the least likely of saviors, you are my last choice and my last resort.","entry_meta":"(1999)","id":284},{"author":"KIT ROBINSON","author_meta":"(1949–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"The Person","text":"for Lyn Hejinian Increasingly, then, the person becomes a way of doing something, never explicitly experienced as such, because it is the world that is felt, its mute pressure filling out the corners, as of a rhyme. The room gathers each sitter in. The light changes, imperceptibly, always. One, the inevitable protagonist of a paragraph built on second thought, would like nothing better than to sum up and in the application describe that process by which so much detail has been set aside, so as to be clear of it, to stand in the pale light unframed by the body of years spent in collation. The assembly of days, none identical to the last, has taken up much time. So many sources, however, have informed the final mix, that it bears an irreducible mark, one not possible to describe in so many words. The person looks around and sees the same things. It is necessary to change without touching them. Here a street or a sky or a bridge become emblems in an elaborate game whose rules the person is only beginning to understand, although an avid player since early childhood. Perhaps it is the availability of such images that prevents one from recognizing their true meaning until much later, when one has withdrawn or been withdrawn from them, through an illness or brush with death, but one has not had time for such things, or been spared them by luck. Mostly it is the call of others that diverts the attention. If a child or a woman or a man or an old man or a young woman or a person of questionable age approaches you, what do you think? Many wish to first get out of the way. Others jump at what may seem like the main chance. The one particular person I have come to consider has thought rather to be of assistance, to the extent possible, in relation to this, that and the other thing, however. In this way, this person has become an extraordinary resource for a good number of people. What remains to be seen is a person, walking over a bridge. What is of more interest, however, from the point of view of a junkyard of mangled signs heaped up in silent protest against a century devoted to the material possession of form, is when a person eludes any simple formulation relative to that interest. The person is, as cliché-ridden isomorph, a creature of habit. One has certain convictions, obsessions, eccentricities, stylistic features, indications that set one, by prescription, apart. All this is begging the question, a delay tactic, for what most impresses its mark on the spirit, an insistence lived, a laugh in the face of horror, marks its presence without recourse to definition. It is the world that is felt, but it is a made place, and within it they make it who alter its composition simply by living and doing as they will and can do.","entry_meta":"(1998)","id":285},{"author":"CHARLES BERNSTEIN","author_meta":"(1950–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","text":"Comraderie turns to rivalry when 12 medical students learn that only seven of them will be admitted to the hospital.A CIA agent is ordered to feign a breakdown to trap a spy at a mental hospital.

Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man’s legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country.

Now we dreamed desperately. Those who couldn’t remember their dreams became insurance risks, showing up frequently in the papers as suicides or crime statistics. We were advised to look for mates who appeared to be affluent dreamers, heavy eyelids, an avid indifference to appearance, lights out early, very early in bedroom windows. You may be surprised we took mates at all, but we still grew lonely and wanted something to touch, even if it vanished when we opened our eyes. Those who excelled at dreaming were chosen to represent us. The forty hour week was replaced by the forty hour sleep. It was through our sleep experience that we earned advancement at work. New television series featured dream phantoms to replace late night horror shows, falling dreams instead of daily soap operas, and flying dreams for children. Who succumbed to the old feeling of helplessness when the paraphernalia for heroism was stored in every brain? Soon even our buildings were designed to resemble pillows and our young ones judged intelligent not by how soon they spoke the hackneyed Mama but by how accomplished they were at sleeping. Intelligence tests were given to determine what they could sleep through and our prodigies withstood avalanches easily as the cracking of porcelain thimbles. As with all major changes in civilization, the historians were at first puzzled. Many had retired to rest homes where they dreamed the rebuilding of the Roman Empire, the finding of a lost continent, the absence of Hitler. We had lost all sense of nationalism and all instinct for aggression. One man, one pillow became the slogan and even the most impoverished seemed satisfied. Some awake even part of the day suspected that the government had foreseen the outcome.

Sometimes magic is the obscurest impostor in play. An obscure rationalization imposes the word magic on Rousseau. Now remember play has nothing to do with that Rousseauian freedom found in refusal. Refusal more than anything else ends play. And so we might play a game called the conjuring of Rousseau. It might go like this, let’s pretend that Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the pawn in our game. On one side of the board is society. On the other side of the board is solitude. We can each pick a goal. One of us tries to force Rousseau into society, the other tries to land him in solitude. Whoever gets the pawn to the goal wins. Let’s say Rousseau is walking along a Boulevard in silent reverie. The board, by the way, is made up of parks and boulevards, so when Rousseau advances he is always being advanced by way of a park or boulevard. Sometimes a player will draw a card that says, What do you want, Jean-Jacques Rousseau? If the spinner lands on I would like to go home, then the pawn is returned to the beginning and Rousseau sets out again from the starting spot. If the spinner lands on I would like to tell the truth, the player gets to spin again until he gets something he likes; since truth is bound to both solitude and society, this move becomes a matter of preference. In the center of the board is a personage with great powers, she is a witch. If Jean-Jacques lands on her spot it is because she has called him up. She calls him up, because his travels fascinate her. Now, this is extremely problematic. If Rousseau realizes that she has called him up, then he sees himself as a ghost. The player has a choice at this point, to get out of or stay in the ghost game. If it is decided to stay in the ghost game, Rousseau is provided with a series of options that he never recognized when he was alive. He can, for instance, opt to infiltrate society without being noticed. He can observe those who outlived him. He could, if he were on the ladder to revenge, scare them to death. They could become equals in death. Or he could live with the witch, who loves to make good on her resources. This he admires enormously; although, she does not quite consider him her equal. With her, his solitude is indeed complete, since no one in the game believes in her existence.","entry_meta":"(1995)","id":301},{"author":"CARLA HARRYMAN","author_meta":"(1952–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Matter","text":"Love was alone with love.

I put down the card to see what would happen while I opened my legs. You open now, I said. And love responded quickly. You are a good player. Have you been playing long? I learned from an expert, said love. Is the expert still living. Yes, she is. A she, I said. Love was impatient and wanted to know if I had another move. I closed my legs up to see if that counted. Look at your hand, said love trying to be patient. And you, I said, prefer these cards over other forms of excitement. If you can’t play, you’ll never meet the expert, love replied. I didn’t really care, but my body was standing on end at the thought of fucking.

Although we are unprepared, the house is ready. The door waits to be smashed open, the drawers to be pulled and left gaping. The things—whatever things he chooses—wait to be taken. They are always ready to be released from our care, from their obligations to us. The thing with sentimental value especially waits with a saintly indifference. And the things are transfigured, given new meaning, as if they joined orders, took vows. When we meet them again, if we do, in the monastery of the pawnshop, they have earned a new humility, and we must try to persuade them back to their old life. Or we might glimpse at the symphony concert the stolen watch, like a golden snowflake, strapped to a young woman’s wrist. The thief is a communicant in a country that worships in secret, on the run. He improvises the elements of his ritual at every ceremony. In this one a gold watch with clasp and a cunning shell to cover its face. In that one an oblong case that may contain a violin or high powered rifle. In this one a collection of objects—an answering machine, a camera, a pair of binoculars, a laptop computer. In another, moving service, a .38 caliber revolver. In every period of worship these things take on the numinosity of faith, each with its inherent worth abruptly revealed. Theologians spring up among our friends. Our visitor, they say, had been watching us, studying us, there was some plan. We join them in speculating on the location of our possessions, the new plane they occupy, and their miraculous return. The man spraying to check for fingerprints says this scrotebag will not be back. He finds nothing and crowns each empty place with a halo of soot. His severity and solemnity are like John Knox’s, if he smoked after the service and complained bitterly about sin moving into the better neighborhoods, because of the mayor’s new policies. Knox fuming, after his fulminations in the pulpit. Knox driving off in a crime scene van. We attached ourselves to things, and now we feel like amputees. The wrist of the watch, severed. The fingers snapped from the neck of the violin. The eye of the camcorder plucked out. Where the laptop sat, a lapse. We try to feel lucky in our violation. He could have burned down the house. He could have kidnapped the children. We could have surprised him and driven after him and been shot dead through the windshield. He didn’t take the wedding album. He didn’t take the TV. Here, safe in its drawer, he didn’t take this. There, in plain sight on the desk, he didn’t take that. Now we see others as thieves or not as thieves. Anyone we pass is a felon or an upstanding citizen. We listen to the gospel of electronic security. Listen and believe. It is religious, but not a religion that brings joy or consolation. We enter the feast days of anxiety, the high holidays of suspicion. This letter goes out with a list of things encoded that we still possess.","entry_meta":"(2001)","id":303},{"author":"MARY RUEFLE","author_meta":"(1952–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Monument","text":"A small war had ended. Like all wars, it was terrible. Things which had stood in existence were now vanished. I had come back because I had survived and survivors come back, there is nothing else left for them to do. I had been on long travels connected to the war, and I had been to the centerpiece of the war, that acre of conflagration. And now I was sitting on a park bench, watching ducks land and take off from a pond. They too had survived, though I had no way of knowing if they were the same ducks from before the war or if they were the offspring of ducks who had died in the war. It was a warm day in the capital and people were walking without coats, dazed by the warmth, which was not the heat of war, which had engulfed them, but the warmth of expansion, in which would grow the idea of a memorial to the war, which had ended, and of which I was a veteran architect. I knew I would be called upon for my ideas in regards to this memorial and I had entered the park aimlessly, trying to escape my ideas, as I had been to the centerpiece, that acre of conflagration, and from there the only skill that returned was escapement, any others died with those who possessed them. I was dining with friends that evening, for the restaurants and theatres and shops had reopened, the capital was like a great tablecloth being shaken in midair so that life could be smoothed and reset and go on, and I had in my mind a longing to eat, and to afterwards order my favorite dessert, cherries jubilee, which would be made to flame and set in the center of the table, and I had in my mind the idea of submitting to the committee a drawing of an enormous plate of cherries, perpetually burning, to be set in the center of the park, as a memorial to the war, that acre of conflagration. And perhaps also in my mind was the hope that such a ridiculous idea would of course be ignored and as a result I would be left in peace, the one thing I desired, even beyond cherries. And I could see the committee, after abandoning my idea, remaining in their seats fighting over the designs of others, far into the after-hours of the work day, their struggles never seeming to end, and then I wanted to submit an idea of themselves as a memorial for the war, the conference table on an island in the middle of the pond, though at least some of them would have to be willing to die in the enactment. And then I saw on the ground an unnamed insect in its solitary existence, making its laborious way through tough blades of grass that threatened its route, and using a stick that lay nearby I drew a circle around the animal—if you can call him that—and at once what had been but a moment of middling drama became a theatre of conflict, for as the insect continued to fumble lopsided in circles it seemed to me that his efforts had increased, not only by my interest in them, but by the addition of a perimeter which he now seemed intent on escaping. I looked up then, and what happened next I cannot describe without a considerable loss of words, I saw a drinking fountain. It had not suddenly appeared, it must have always been there, it must have been there as I walked past it and sat down on the bench, it must have been there yesterday, and during the war, and in the afternoons before the war. It was a plain gunmetal drinking fountain, of the old sort, a basin on a pedestal, and it stood there, an ordinary object that had become an unspeakable gift, a wonder of civilization, and I had an overwhelming desire to see if it worked, I stood up then and approached it timidly, as I would a woman, I bent low and put my hand on its handle and my mouth hovered over its spigot—I wanted to kiss it, I was going to kiss it—and I remembered with a horrible shock that in rising from the bench I had stepped on and killed the insect, I could hear again its death under my left foot, though this did not deter me from finishing my kiss, and as the water came forth with a low bubbling at first and finally an arch that reached my mouth, I began to devise a secret route out of the park that would keep me occupied for some time, when I looked up, holding the miraculous water in my mouth, and saw the ducks in mid-flight, their wings shedding water drops which returned to the pond, and remembered in amazement that I could swallow, and I did, then a bit of arcane knowledge returned to me from an idle moment of reading spent years ago, before the war: that a speculum is not only an instrument regarded by most with horror, as well as an ancient mirror, and a medieval compendium of all knowledge, but a patch of color on the lower wing segments of most ducks and some other birds. Thus I was able, in serenest peace, to make my way back to my garret and design the memorial which was not elected and never built, but remained for me an end to the war that had ended.","entry_meta":"(2001)","id":304},{"author":"KILLARNEY CLARY","author_meta":"(1953–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","text":"Because the ones I work for do not love me, because I have said too much and I haven’t been sure of what is right and I’ve hated the people I’ve trusted, because I work in an office and we are lost and when I come home I say their lives are theirs and they don’t know what they apologize for and none of it mended, because I let them beat me and I remember something of mine which not everyone has, and because I lie to keep my self and my hands my voice on the phone what I swallow what hurts me, because I hurt them—I give them the hours I spend away from them and carry them, even in my sleep, at least as the nag of a misplaced shoe, for years after I have quit and gone on to another job where I hesitate in telling and I remember and I resent having had to spend more time with them than with the ones I love.","entry_meta":"(1989)","title":"UNTITLED","id":305},{"author":"KILLARNEY CLARY","author_meta":"(1953–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","text":"Life is boundless.

An excursion to the seashore could alter everything. Ah, peregrination... is just so sweet you want to disappear, Bely brayed leaving. Her fertility was mental. After all who can fault the wind? Well, everyone. It wasn’t like her to ask why. She was going to die. She put on another disc. An oblong monologue about herself or transport. Dwelling on events that may never have happened. In her mind’s eye, Alma Ata. And dread of slipping through the tissue of the ridiculous. Listening to the adagio she felt as lonely as the moon, and fell asleep with her hands in her pockets.

A wooly one is most consoling. Find a fur man, born midwinter. Reared in the mountains. Fond of boxing. Make sure he has black rubbery lips, and a sticky sweet mouth. A winter sleeper. Pick one who likes to tussle, who clowns around the kitchen, juggles hot baked potatoes, gnaws playfully on a corner of your apron. Not one mocked by his lumbering instincts, or who’s forever wrestling with himself, tainted with shame, itchy with chagrin, but a good-tempered beast who plunges in greedily, grinning and roaring. His backslapping manner makes him popular with the neighbors, till he digs up and eats their Dutch tulip bulbs. Then you see just how stuffy human beings can be. On Sundays his buddies come over to play watermelon football. When they finally get tired, they collapse on heaps of dried grass and leaves, scratching themselves elaborately, while I hand out big hunks of honeycomb. They’ve no problem swallowing dead bees stuck in the honey. A bear-boy likes to stretch out on the floor and be roughly brushed with a broom. Never tease him about his small tail, which is much like a chipmunk’s. If you do, he’ll withdraw to the hollow of some tree, as my husband has done whenever offended since he first left the broad-leafed woodlands to live in this city, which is so difficult for him. Let him be happy in his own way, filling the bathtub with huckleberries, or packing dark, earthwormy dirt under the sofa. Don’t mention the clawmarks on the refrigerator. You know he can’t retract them. Nothing pleases him more than a violent change in climate, especially if it snows while he’s asleep and he wakes to find the landscape blanketed. Then his teeth chatter with delight. He stamps and paws the air for joy. Exuberance is a bear’s inheritance. He likes northern light. Excuse me, please. His bellow summons me. Let me start again. True, his speech is shaggy music. But by such gruff instruction, I come to know love. It’s difficult to hear the story of his forest years with dry eyes. He always snuffs damply at my hand before kissing it. My fingers tingle at the thought of that sensitive, mobile nose. You’ve no idea how long his tongue is. At night, I get into bed, pajama pockets full of walnuts. He rides me around the garden in the wheelbarrow now that I’m getting heavy with his cubs.

This plea is our last hope for anything. In theory, intimidation can penetrate anything. We all break sooner or later. The letters are carefully packed with case histories that go off like timed explosives. I can see you waiting for each one to go off, wondering if the one you designed for me will do the trick. One summer, you say, a Portuguese fisherman received this letter and burned it. He spent the rest of his life trying to read the ashes. I thought it over. This letter is not sacred. It promises nothing. It is a plea for anything, which is like saying a plea for nothing. There was a faint barking as I walked toward the window. It was the sound dogs make when a stranger approaches. I began to doubt my own presence in the house, my hands opening the window to more barking. You must copy the entire letter, you said. The copies you make, the warning continued, must be indistinguishable from the source. I made the copies. I slept with the words beside me. This morning I thought it over. I tore the letter, replaced it with a blank sheet, folded the sheet in that peculiar way I learned from you. On the coast of Portugal they began a tradition, you say. With the letters still inside the sealed envelopes, the wives of fishermen burn the mail they receive. This way, you tell me, superstition is impossible. But isn’t this a superstition of sorts? It’s really a mockery of belief, you say. I sometimes wonder how we’ve managed to correspond this long through chain letters. I wonder how we’ve been able to sustain this dialogue between two anonymous voices. I think of the widows along the Portuguese coast, their chain mail used as fuel for their stoves.

For 800 years, women’s bound feet were the most beautiful and erotic objects for Chinese men. Tits and buns were nothing compared to a pair of three-inch golden lotuses. They must be crazy or their noses must have had problems. My grandma’s feet, wrapped day and night with layers of bandages, smelled like rotten fish. The asshole in Chinese, the eye of the fart. A 25-year-old single woman in China worries her parents. A 28-year-old single woman worries her friends and colleagues. A 30-year-old single woman worries her bosses.

I was ten years old. Women call menstruation the old ghost, the science book calls it the moon period, and the refined people say the moonlight is flooding the ditch. My first lover vowed to marry me in America after he had my virginity. He had two kids, and an uneducated wife, and dared not ask for a divorce from the police. He took me to see his American Chinese cousin who was staying in the Beijing Hotel and tried to persuade his cousin to sponsor him to come to America. But his cousin sponsored me instead. That’s how I am here and why he went back to his wife and is probably still cursing me. Chinese peasants call their wives: that one in my house; Chinese intellectuals call their wives and concubines: the doll in a golden house; in the socialist system, husbands and wives call each other my lover. The story my grandma never tired of telling was about a man who was punished for his greed and had to walk around with a penis hanging on his forehead. We don’t say fall in love, but talk love.

She goes out in the world, wreaking havoc. The orgasm knows all things are animate. The houses groan with grief and passion. Sometimes a mirror bursts from a wall and shatters, no longer content with mere images. The orgasm tells you to be careful or, in the language of orgasms, to have fears. Orgasms thrive on danger. The orgasm says we are all parts of herself. We are but launching pads for her spiritual development. After she is done with us, she will be ready for fucking angels. The orgasm encourages us to let our minds wander. Usually this is good advice, but sometimes she gets lost in thought. When the orgasm tells you that you are a mere object of her scientific research and the only real man on earth, the orgasm is slowly dissecting your body. The orgasm will peel you like an orange. You may feel exposed, raw, even wounded. The orgasm wants you to live life without the rind. The orgasm thinks people are like dresses. You don’t just buy the first one off the rack. You try them on for size. The orgasm tells you many stories. Some she will never finish. She cannot help herself. She always lies. Such beautiful lies. You want them all. Why would you need truth when you can have an orgasm? Every now and then a casualty occurs. An orgasm accidentally injures or murders a man. She is startled by the moans escaping from his lips at this moment, so much like those of pleasure. She wonders if human pain is a kind of celebration. Sometimes the orgasm falls in love with you. She cannot tear herself from your pungent flesh. For days you walk around, gasping for air. You are in a state of constant excitement. One day the orgasm abandons you. The entire world is reduced to a memory, a mere elegy to an orgasm. In a single sitting a hungry orgasm can consume a man, socks and all. Women take more time. Many dislike the speed of orgasm, the way she comes and goes and takes all she can get. The orgasm cannot help herself. She has no tomorrow. According to the orgasm, there is no difference between real and imaginary events. Everything is a secret message only she can decipher. Often the orgasm tells you a story about you. About you and about the secret powers lying dormant within you. She waits for you on street corners and follows you down dark alleys, whispering your name, softly, her hands passing continually over your hair, caressing your bare shoulders. At night you sleep fitfully and dream of her. You are unable to tell whether you are a dream of the orgasm, or if the orgasm is a dream of you. The orgasm is very happy to be an orgasm. Sometimes she wonders what it would be like to be a man, sort of like the small boy who fills a Mason jar with spiders, wondering what it’s like to be a fly.","entry_meta":"(1993)","id":322},{"author":"NIN ANDREWS","author_meta":"(1958–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Always Have a Joyful Mind","text":"How did I ever stand it?

There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust. To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row. To the right, a field of wheat, a field of hay, young grasses breaking the soil, filling their allotted land with the rich, slow-waving spectacle of their grain. As for the farmers, they are, for the most part, indistinguishable, here the tractor is red, there yellow; here a pair of dirty hands, there a pair of dirty hands. They are cultivators of the soil. They grow crops by pattern, by acre, by foresight, by habit. What corn is to one, wheat is to the other, and though to some eyes the similarities outweigh the differences it would be as unthinkable for the second to commence planting corn as for the first to switch over to wheat. What happens in the gully between them is no concern of theirs, they say, so long as the plough stays out, the weeds stay in the ditch where they belong, though anyone would notice the windsewn cornstalks poking up their shaggy ears like young lovers run off into the bushes, and the kinship of these wild grasses with those the farmer cultivates is too obvious to mention, sage and dun-colored stalks hanging their noble heads, hoarding exotic burrs and seeds, and yet it is neither corn nor wheat that truly flourishes there, nor some jackalopian hybrid of the two. What grows in that place is possessed of a beauty all its own, ramshackle and unexpected, even in winter, when the wind hangs icicles from the skeletons of briars and small tracks cross the snow in search of forgotten grain; in the spring the little trickle of water swells to welcome frogs and minnows, a muskrat, a family of turtles, nesting doves in the verdant grass; in summer it is a thoroughfare for raccoons and opossums, field mice, swallows and black birds, migrating egrets, a passing fox; in autumn the geese avoid its abundance, seeking out windrows of toppled stalks, fatter grain more quickly discerned, more easily digested. Of those that travel the local road, few pay that fertile hollow any mind, even those with an eye for what blossoms, vetch and timothy, early forsythia, the fatted calf in the fallow field, the rabbit running for cover, the hawk’s descent from the lightning-struck tree.

He will drain his voice to let Liv know she cannot move toward birth without trespassing on here: To succumb to life is to be gummed to the reverberating scum seemingly arrested.

Yes the greatest of your sister’s facial pimples did outweigh a Turkey. I was eating Vulture Beast Cream, I was eating Lippy Dung Corn, and I said Your ugly dog is very ugly, for he is. And that is when I turned and a snowflake banged into my eye like a rusty barge and I killed your gloomy dog with a mitten. For I have bombed your cat and stabbed it. For I am the ambassador of this wheelbarrow and you are the janitor of a dandelion. Indeed, you are a teacher of great chickens, for you are from the town of Fat Blastoroma, O tawdry realtor. For I have clapped your dillywong in a sizeable door. You have an achy knee which is where I clubbed your achy and pompous knee. I shoot your buffalo, may you be hanged by the upper lip and somehow burned in a canoe. Is your butt driving through traffic that it should toot so at the world? I am averse to urine, yet I shake your hand upon occasion; I have made a whiskey of your tears—and Joe-Bob made a fluliqueur of your night-mucus; That some of your gas has been banging around the market like a small soldier carrying a table. God booby.1 I overlook your titties. Your sneeze erased the blackboard and your cough knocked a dog into loneliness; For you remind me of a dog hurled over a roof—yapping to no effect. And furthermore the habitual peristalsis in your bowels sounds like a barfight in a whale. In addition, that as a boy you lassoed storks with a petty friend named Jerry. And just as you swallowed a cherry’s stone and produced a tree, you recently ate a burger and found a bull honking among your feces. For I would more expect a Pigeon to tote a rifle than a wise syllable issue from your cheesepipe. And as your nose is packed with Error I advise you to pick it often. For you are a buttock. Indeed you are the balls of the bullock and the calls of the peacock; you are the pony in the paddock near the bullock and the peacock; you are the futtock on the keel and the fetlock or the heel of the pony in the paddock, Indeed you are the burdock on the fetlock and the beetle on the burdock and the mite on the beetle on the burdock on the fetlock of the pony in the paddock and the padlock of the gate of the paddock of the bullock and the peacock. Thus with you I am fed-up. For you are Prufrock and I am Wild Bill Hickok at a roadblock with the wind in my forelock and a bullet in my flintlock. You are Watson I am Sherlock. For you are the hillock and I am the hill; I am Hitchcock, O Buttock. You—are Cecil B. De Mille. Yes he hath thrown a squirrel at me which came flapping through the air like a disjointed hairbrush. The fact that the sequins on your dress caused you to look like the instrument panel of an airliner during a three-engine flame-out did not escape anyone’s attention; That your heart is a colostomy bag2 and your brain is the Peanut of Abomination.3 And that the cake frosting you just ate is actually earwax. And since suing you would be like suing a squirrel, and since I would rather eat a mixture of powdered mummy and water than talk with you again4, I will try to punch your head hard enough5 so that you will not dare chase me, but not so hard that others will hunt me. For you have killed my family6 and I have killed your dog, your bird, and the mouse of your daughter; Your cousins Rosie, Yolanda, Amelia, Harriet, Johanna, and Carol have all been decapitated. But we pushed Judy over a cliff. Just as the fog is shackled to the dirty valley stream and cannot go out loosely to join the loopy clouds who contain hollering eagles and whooshing falcons but must stand low and bound and suffer the scratch of a bush and the round poop of deer and the odd black spoor of the American black bear or the bump of a car on a road or the sick crashes of paintings thrown from a rural porch, so also is your mind bound to the low reach of trash and the wet wan game of worms and the dripping dick of a torpid dog—and unlike the clouds above you you do not feel swell but clammy and pokey and sweaty: a leaf-smell follows you, odd breezes juke your brook-chaff, lambs and rachel-bugs go up and forth in you, and when a car passes through you, windows down, the car-pillows in that car get puffy, absorbing water in the air, and those pillows become bosoms, gaseous moving bosoms, and that is the nearest you come to bosoms. For these reasons and more, Dolores rightly asked as you walked by, What is that smell that smells so much it is audible, is it a spoor? I said it is the smell of a dillywong slammed in a door. Or the Dingleberry of Reason. Some have called your mouth Bippy-Swingset, and someone who seemed to resemble your physician called the orifice in question the birth-hole of a Raven, whereas it is common knowledge all Ravens are born in burning forests, for the beast is a charred contraption, being well-cooked and near dead. Some say that Crows are born out of a sail’s white leeward wall, others that thun Crow is as an millet-corporal to the Raven’s brook-colonel, that a pelican has goiter and that a Crow is in truth the silhouette of a gull knocked loose from that gull, which can happen in the case of an Sudden Explosion, where, in the afterclap and initial desolation, gulls will breach the sky with such celerity their silhouettes break free and fall like dark packs to the ground, which is why the crow is a kind of angry bird, being now without grace and having a charred voice. Some insist the crow is in fact a drunk, though at which saloon he find his beer or how he should pay for it, or whether he have beer, port, or an highball, these poets will not aver: either way he follows not the Doctrine of Christ and is a derisive and condemnable bird and ought therefore to be avoided and never frighten a gull. Another annoying beast can be the Squirrel. For he is midget blowhard. And like a pipe thrown at an eagle I will send you folding to the humpy. I heard you once enquiring how you were born and told you then that you were created because your mother subjected her privates to the attentions of a bull, which is why you insist a cow says Ma when it is clearly saying Moo. For: There was an Bee, who, flinging himself against his shadow in a Brooke, did drown, and so washed of his own Enmity, he did sail like a dark and brittle Bubble, to the general amphitheater of the Sea, where he was drowned a second time. Thus first he was sunk from life and second from the Known; and now lies twice dead. Like this captious Bee, you will drop from the world and sink to oblivion.","entry_meta":"(2000)","id":334},{"author":"JOE WENDEROTH","author_meta":"(1966–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Twelve Epistles from Letters to Wendy’s","text":"Today I was thinking that it might be nice to be able, in one’s last days, to move into a Wendy’s. Perhaps a Wendy’s life-support system could even be created and given a Wendy’s slant; liquid fries, for instance, and burgers and Frosties continually dripped into one’s vegetable dream locus. It would intensify the visits of the well, too, to see that such a care is being taken for their destiny. Very high on marijuana brownies, I could not speak today at the register. I kept stepping aside for other customers and staring hard at the menu. I was overwhelmed by the chicken sandwich pictured there, but had no words for it. I kept saying, there, that one... the man dressed like a woman. It’s hard to get served when one understands the signifier as a process. Still high on those brownies, but coming down. I’ve eaten, in the past twenty-four hours, so very many burgers and chicken sandwiches. The Sea of Coke is heavy today with meat—its cold swells with the meaty goodness that objects to language. Some kids drift by, talking. One of them says, that sucks dead donkey dicks, and the other agrees. Imagine. Naturally I think about smashing the skulls and the rib-cages of the other customers. They stand in line so smug—like they were safe, outside the desires of or for an other. It’s as if, for them, there is no other’s desire—as if desire was one thing, and was ours. Restraining myself is not dishonest. It’s a way of maintaining a keen sense of the unforeseeable injuries which shall certainly reunite us. It would bring me to despair to think that I could get a Frosty in my own kitchen. I need believe that a Frosty can only be gotten outside of where I ordinarily dwell. To be constantly in the place of real Frosties—this is unthinkable, somehow unbearable. The fact is, to be a subject of language is to desire an Event, and an Event needs a nothing to move out of, to seem to begin. I eavesdrop on people at Wendy’s. I notice they never talk about their assholes. It’s not that I think an asshole, as an abstract as Platonic form if you will, is so interesting. It’s specific assholes that are interesting—my asshole as compared with Nick’s, yours as compared with Ted’s or Mary’s. How one experiences another’s asshole speaks volumes—it seems selfish not to make these volumes readily available. This idiotic notion that one should love the other customers. Love here really only means: agree, for the time being, not to attack. People pretend, though, that each customer is an irreplaceable piece of some priceless puzzle—like the death of each customer is significant for every other customer. It’s just not true; one cannot love what one does not know, and—fortunately—one knows very little. I can say without hesitation that if Wendy’s ever started to deliver I would end my life. And in a way, my suicide would mimic Wendy’s decision to deliver. That is, I would decide that my blood, which, in my body, made sense, should flow out in to the dust, where it makes just more dust. Our homes are dust? you ask. Yes, our homes are dust. Don’t pretend you are surprised. I’ve been sort of hesitant to mention this, but I believe that one of your employees—you must know the one I speak of—is a beaver. It’s impossible to look into her face, to hear the sounds she makes, and to see the way she moves, the way she carries bits of wood, and to not feel that this is a beaver. I’ve not mentioned this before because, obviously, beavers are powerful creatures. These fucking teeny-bopper cunts—they’ll steal your man as soon as look at you. Even if you don’t have a man, they’ll steal him. They’ll steal him and they’ll take him back to their fucking teeny-bopper bedroom. Then they’ll suck his dick real slow as though they’ve never sucked a dick before and they’ll say, it’s so big. even if it isn’t. And then afterwards they’ll act like they never said it was big at all. As I look around the restaurant at all the beautiful folks enjoying themselves, I wonder what catastrophe awaits each one. Young man, will your heart explode? Will your intestines fill with blood? Perhaps a seizure on a boat in the middle of a lake. The sun shining down. The stars concealed once and for all. I always feel less anxious when I recognize that the collision is already well under way. My previous statements were made in haste. I was hungry and confused, and I longed for purpose. I wanted to seem like I was in the process of focusing in on something important. I wanted to feel purpose rising like an ancient city from the excavator’s pick and shovel. I wanted this so much that I rushed—I swung my pick wildly, and I brought a great delicate city to the dust it had always verged on.","entry_meta":"(2000)","id":335},{"author":"LISA JARNOT","author_meta":"(1967–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Still Life","text":"Where we finally move closer, but instead we don’t move closer at all, we just have an understanding that we want to move closer, which is a form of moving closer, or at least something to think about, that it was an idea, moving closer, though not ultimately satisfying, though something, on one or two or three occasions, during a single night, moving closer, and the sands accumulate into sand paintings, that are colorblind, and filled with raccoons, and the steps of the sand toward the pyramid of sand are altered, wearing pumpkins on their heads, wishing to be loved, in the steps of the sand, terrified, or not terrified, moving closer, identifying with raccoons, on certain evenings, that maybe to go from there, because obviously, the sand and raccoons accumulate, taking years, listening to the traffic, saying is it quiet where you live, near the sand and the raccoons, in a quiet room, near the sounds of all the traffic that moves closer, on the periphery, that the thing is this, accumulating, getting closer, to the raccoons and the traffic that moves closer, having moved, having said that moving closer is ideal, having said thank you, and so forth, that the so forth is moving closer, forward, toward what in most of the universe would have been a scene, where the sand is forgotten, and the raccoons, and the accumulation of pyramids, and clothing items, and various identifications, and so forth, but instead, one by one, or one, or two or three times awkwardly, there is news, and there are raccoons, and the raccoons are screeching in the yard, as if to say something about the grains of sand, at opposite sides of the universe, screeching, with their suits and ties, bringing news, like Tom Brokaw, colorblind, reliable, and standing in the sand, and the news, which should not be true, but is, that there are raccoons, screeching, outside, in the traffic, near the sand, and on the news, and the curious figure that is him, there, who is reliable, and like the sand, accumulating, rightly, while how wrong it is, the news, that there is a rightness about him, the news of the raccoons, so close enough, and safely in the sand.","entry_meta":"(2001)","id":336},{"author":"LISA JARNOT","author_meta":"(1967–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"Ode","text":"For let me consider him who pretends to be the pizza delivery man and is instead the perfect part of day, for the fact he is a medium, for the eight to twelve inches of snow he tends to be, for he who covers the waterfront, for he that was handmade in a tiny village in japan, for that he is more than just an envelope or inside-out balloon, for that he can always find the scotch tape, for that he resembles a river in mid-December muddied over, for that he has seen the taxi cabs on fire in the rain, for that he is like the heat beneath the desk lamp, for that he is not a tiny teal iguana, for that it is he who waits for me inside cafes, for that he has hands and legs, for that he exceeds the vegetable, for that he is the rest of the balance continuing huge.","entry_meta":"(2001)","id":337},{"author":"KAREN VOLKMAN","author_meta":"(1967–)","source":"Great_American_Prose_Poems","title":"It Could Be a Bird","text":"It could be a bird that says summer, that says gather no late failing harvest in a wealth of arms.

Mango was fruit wrapped in brown paper bags, hidden like ripening secrets in the kitchen oven.

Mangos, watching like amber cat’s eyes; mangos, perfectly still in their speckled maroon shells like giant unhatched eggs.

People called him that because from the time he was a boy, when someone would give him a smack on one side of the head, he would turn his cheek for another. His schoolmates would take away his candies and cakes, strip him almost naked in the street, and when he got home, his parents, one on one side, one on the other, would pinch him and slap him until his ears rang. And so he grew up, until he became a man. How this poor Juan suffered. He got smallpox, but he didn’t die, though his face was left looking as though a dozen hens had been pecking at it. He was sent to jail in the place of another Juan—Juan Lanas. And he suffered all this with such patience that all the townspeople, when they said There goes Juan Bueno! would laugh out loud. And then the day came when this fellow got married. One morning St. Joseph, in excellent humor, with his halo of glory upon his head, a new cloak upon his back, bright new sandals upon his feet, and his long flowering staff to aid him, went out for a walk through the village in which Juan Bueno lived and suffered. Christmas night was near, and St. Joseph was thinking about his baby, Jesus, and the preparations for his birth; he strolled along blessing the good believers and from time to time softly humming some carol or another. As he was walking along one street he heard a great racket, and much moaning and lamenting, and he found—oh, grievous sight!—Juan Bueno’s wife, bam, bam, bam, giving her wretched spouse what-for. Halt! called out the putative father of the divine Savior. I’ll have no such rows in my presence! Just that short and sweet. The fierce Gorgon grew calmer, the couple made their peace, and when Juan told his tale of woe good St. Joseph consoled him, gave him a pat or two on the back, and as he bade him good night, he said to him, It will all be all right, my son. Soon your troubles will be over. In the meantime, I’ll help you as much as I can. You know, with whatever comes along. You can find me in the parish church, the altar to the right. So long, now. Happy as could be, was good Juan Bueno at these tidings. And it may well be imagined that he went off, day after day, almost hour after hour, to visit the shoulder he knew he could cry on.—Lord, this has happened! Lord, this other! Lord, can you imagine what’s happened now! He asked for everything, and everything was granted. Well, not quite everything, because he was too embarrassed to tell the saint that his tyrant of a wife had not lost the habit of boxing his ears. So when St. Joseph would ask him, What’s that bump on your head there? he would laugh and change the subject. But St. Joseph knew very well . . . and he admired Juan’s forbearance. One day Juan came in terribly sad and downcast. I’ve lost, he moaned, a bag of silver I’d put away. Could you find it for me? Well, that’s really St. Anthony’s job, but we’ll see what we can do. And indeed when Juan returned to his house, he found the little bag of silver. Another day Juan came in with his face all swollen and one eye practically falling out of its socket. The cow you gave me has disappeared! And the kind saint replied: Go home, you’ll find it. And another time: The mule you were so kind as to give me has run off! And the saint replied: Now, now, off home with you, the mule will come back. And so on, for many months. Until one day the saint was not in the cheeriest of moods, and Juan Bueno came in with his face looking like an overripe tomato and his head all squashed out of shape. When the good saint saw him, he went, Hm, hm. Lord, I come to ask another favor of you. My wife has left me, and since you are so good . . . St. Joseph’s patience with Juan Bueno had reached its limit. He lifted his flowering staff and smacked Juan Bueno on the very top of his head, at a spot exactly between his ears. To hell with you—where you’ll find her for yourself, you blockhead!","id":354},{"author":"MARCEL SCHWOB","author_meta":"(France, 1867–1905)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Cyril Tourneur: Tragic Poet","text":"Cyril Tourneur was born out of the union of an unknown god with a prostitute. Proof enough of his divine origin has been found in the heroic atheism to which he succumbed. From his mother he inherited the instinct for revolt and luxury, the fear of death, the thrill of passion and the hate of kings. His father bequeathed him his desire for a crown, his pride of power and his joy of creating. To him both parents handed down their taste for nocturnal things, for a red glare in the night, and for blood. The exact date of his birth is not known, though we are told that he appeared one dark day during a pestilential year. No celestial protector watched over the woman whose body was swollen with this infant god, for the plague touched her several days before her confinement, and the door of her little house was marked with a red cross. At the moment when Cyril Tourneur was coming into the world the sexton at the cemetery began to toll the bell for the burial of the dead. Then, quite as his father had disappeared into that heaven common to all gods, so a green cart dragged his mother away to the common grave of men. That night is said to have been so dark that the sexton had to hold a torch by the pesthouse door while the grim carter gathered his load. Another historian tells us how the mists upon the river Thames by Cyril Tourneur’s birthplace were shot with scarlet rays while the sound of the bells was like the barking of cynocephales. There is little doubt but that a real star rose flaming over the house tops. The new born child shook his feeble fists as its fiery, malevolent gleams mottled his upturned face. So came Cyril Tourneur into the empty vastness of the Cimmerian night. It is impossible to discover what were his thoughts or habits before he reached the age of thirty. The signs of his latent divinity had no record, nor do we know how he first recognized his hidden sovereignty. An obscure list of his blasphemies has come to light. From this document we know that he declared Moses nothing more than a juggler, while one named Heriot, he said, was an infinitely cleverer juggler than Moses. The beginning of religion, according to Cyril, consisted in terrorizing man. Christ, he held, merited death more than Barabbas, though Barabbas were thief and murderer. Should he, Cyril Tourneur, write a new religion, he said, he could vow to establish it upon a finer, more admirable basis. He thought the style of the New Testament wholly repugnant. He declared that his right to coin money was as good as the queen of England’s, and furthermore, that he knew a man named Poole, a prisoner at Newgate, with whose aid he meant some day to strike gold pieces in his own image. A pious soul has erased the more terrible affirmations from this document. Cyril Tourneur’s words have been overheard and his gestures thought to indicate an atheism even more vindictive. He has been represented to us cloaked in a long black robe, a glorious twelve-starred crown on his head, his feet resting on the celestial sphere while he holds the terrestrial globe in his right hand. Pale as a wax taper on an altar, with eyes deeply aglow like burning incense, he walked the streets on stormy nights when the pest was over the city. Some have said he had a strange mark like a seal on his right thigh, but the point will never be verified since no one saw his body naked after death. For mistress he took a prostitute from Bankside, a girl who had haunted the waterfront streets. He called her Rosamonde. His love for her was unique. On her blonde, innocent face the rouge spots burned like flickering flames, and she was very young. Rosamonde bore Cyril Tourneur a daughter whom he loved. Having been looked at by a prince, Rosamonde died tragically, drinking emerald-coloured poison from a transparent cup. Vengeance merged with pride in Cyril’s soul. Night came . . . he walked the Mall, down the full length of that royal promenade, flourishing a torch of burning horsehair to illuminate his face, this poisoner prince. Hatred of all who reign was in his mouth and on his hands. So he became a highwayman, not to steal but to assassinate kings. Various princes who disappeared in those days were lighted to their death by Cyril Tourneur’s torch before he killed them. He would lie in wait along the queen’s highway, hiding near some gravel pit or lime kiln. Selecting his victim from a group of travellers, he would offer to guide the gentleman through the quagmires. At the mouth of the pit he would extinguish his torch and hurl the unsuspecting man into the black hole. The gravel always gave way under their feet and Cyril would roll two enormous stones down to stifle the cries. In the dull glow of the kiln, he would sit through the night watching the cadaver as the lime consumed it. When Cyril Tourneur had thus satisfied his hatred for kings he was assailed by his hatred of the gods. The divine spark within him urged him on to original creation. He dreamed of founding an entire generation out of his own blood—a race of gods on earth. He looked at his daughter. She was pure and desirable. To carry out his plan under the eyes of heaven he chose a cemetery as the most appropriate scene. Vowing to brave death and create a new humanity in the heart of that destruction decreed by the gods, Cyril Tourneur sought among old, dead bones to engender new ones. He carried out this project on the roof of a charnelhouse. The end of his life is lost in a haze of obscurity. We may not be sure what pen has given us The Athiest’s Tragedy and The Revenger’s Tragedy. One legend pretends that the pride of Cyril Tourneur went still farther. He is said to have raised a black throne in his garden. Several persons have seen him sitting there with his gold crown on his head, though they all ran away, frightened by the long blue aigrettes waving to and fro above him. He read the poems of Empedocles in the manuscript. He often expressed his admiration for the manner in which the ancient poet died. No one saw the manuscript of Empedocles after Cyril Tourneur disappeared. That year the plague was come again, and the people of London took refuge on barges floating midstream in the Thames. One night a meteor flashed across the face of the moon. Moving with a sinister roar it whirled like a globe of white fire toward Cyril Tourneur’s house. On his black throne, in his black robes and his golden crown, the man waited for the comet. Like a battle on the stage, an ominous blast of trumpets sounded a funereal fanfare across the night. In a shimmering, sanguine blaze, Cyril Tourneur was borne away to some unknown god in the somber, stormy regions of the sky.","id":355},{"author":"PAUL VALÉRY","author_meta":"(France, 1871–1945)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Last Visit to Mallarmé","text":"I saw Stéphane Mallarmé for the last time on the 14th of July, 1898, at Valvins. When lunch was over, he took me into his study. Four paces long by two paces wide; the window opening onto the Seine and onto the forest through foliage rent apart by light, and the smallest movements of the shining river faintly reflected on the walls. Mallarmé was worried about the finishing touches to the construction of the Coup de Dés. The inventor was contem-plating and touching up with a pencil this new machine which the Lahure Press had agreed to construct. Nothing had so far been undertaken—or even considered—to give the form of the text a significance and an effect comparable to those of the text itself. Just as the everyday use of our limbs makes us almost forget their existence and neglect the variety of their resources, and just as it happens that an artist in the use of the human body sometimes points out to us all their suppleness, at the cost of his life which he consumes in exercises and which he exposes to the dangers of his addiction, so the habitual use of language, the practice of reading at random, and the use of everyday expressions, weaken the understanding of these too familiar acts and banish the very conception of their power and of their possible perfection, unless some person survives and dedicates himself who is particularly disdainful of the easy ways of the mind, but singularly attentive to what he can produce that is most unexpected and most subtle. I was in the presence of such a person. Nothing told me that I should never see him again. On this golden day there was no raven to foretell it. Everything was calm and certain. . . . But while Mallarmé was talking to me, with his finger on the page, I remember that my mind began to contemplate this particular moment. Absent-mindedly I gave it an almost absolute value. Near him while he was still alive, I thought of his destiny as already realized. Born for the delight of some and to the dismay of others, and to the amazement of all; for the latter a madness and an absurdity; for his own kind a marvel of pride, elegance and intellectual modesty, a few poems had sufficed for him to put in doubt the very purpose of literature. His work, difficult to understand and impossible to neglect, divided literate people. Poor and without honors, the nakedness of his condition disgraced all the advantages that others had; but he was assured, without having looked for it, of extraordinary loyalty. As for him, whose wise, disdainful victim’s smile quietly disposed of the universe, he had never asked anything of the world but the most precious and rarest things it contained. He found them in himself. We went into the country. The artificial poet gathered the simplest flowers. Our arms were filled with corn-flowers and poppies. The air was on fire; the splendor absolute; the silence full of intoxication and communication; death impossible or unimportant; everything amazingly beautiful, afire and asleep; and the landscape trembled. In the sun, in the immense arc of the cloudless sky, I dreamed of an incandescent space where nothing distinct exists, where nothing lasts, but where nothing ends, as if destruction itself was destroyed before it was accomplished. I lost my perception of the difference between being and not-being. Sometimes music gives us this impression, which is beyond all others. Is not poetry, I thought, the supreme pastime of transmuting ideas?. . . Mallarmé pointed out to me the plain which summer was already beginning to turn to gold; Look, he said, it is the first drum-beat of autumn on the earth. When autumn came, he was no more.","id":356},{"author":"MACEDONIO FERNÁNDEZ","author_meta":"(Argentina, 1874–1952)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"A Novel for Readers with Nerves of Steel","text":"A Sunday rain was falling, completely by mistake, since it was Tuesday, the dry day of the week par excellence.

Without disturbing this embroiled state of affairs I pushed back my chair, making the noise with which a petty tyrant under-assistant-bureaucrat sets twenty underlings quaking in their boots and yawning. I took my rack from its hat and, putting both arms into the sleeves, wound the calendar, ripped that day’s leaf from the clock, put some coal in the icebox, added ice to the stove, supplemented the wall thermometer with all the thermometers I had handy just to ward off an approaching cold spell, and, as a streetcar ran catchably by, I sprang to the sidewalk and fell comfortably into my desk easy chair. Here was a matter for thought: the days were going by all at once and yet no light was shed on the mystery no one knew that there was one of the forthcoming bridge. First: we were shown a diagram of the bridge, showing how far construction had progressed, before anyone had even thought of bringing it into existence; second: a sketch of what the bridge was like when somebody was thinking of it; third: a photograph of someone crossing the bridge; fourth: construction is begun on the first span. In short: the bridge was already finished, but it had to be extended over to the opposite bank, since due to an oversight the bridge had been built to go from one bank to the same bank of the river. And why was it that the government official, whose carefully-considered speech was dedicated, with throat-clearing eloquence, to the bridge, since one or the other of them had a slight cold, I’m not sure which one, accuse it of ingratitude toward the government? You don’t need to be reminded how humanity has suffered from the ingratitude of bridges. Yet, in this case, where did the ingratitude lie? Surely not over on the other side of the river, because the bridge didn’t lead to that side and, in truth, the great labor that lay at hand was to get the water to flow under the bridge. It was the least that could be demanded and expected of a river that had so far played no part in the bridge effort.","id":357},{"author":"KARL KRAUS","author_meta":"(Austria, 1874–1936)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"A pretty little girl hears a pawing noise at the wall of her room.

Up over the sand, and among these stones the water slides in tracery like May blossom or silver mail. A little way out, the long wave lifts itself up laboriously into a shadowy cliff, nods proudly and crumbles, vain and swift, into a thousand sparks of foam. Far out the desolate, ridgy leagues vibrate and murmur with an unintelligible voice, not less intelligible than when one man says, I believe, or another man, I love, or another, I am your friend.

I am excellently suited, you should know, to occupy just such a modest haven, for my nature is altogether delicate, and I am essentially a quiet, polite, and dreamy child, who is made to feel cheerful by people thinking of him that he does not ask for much, and allowing him to take possession of a very, very small patch of existence, where he can be useful in his own way and thus feel at ease. A quiet, sweet, small place in the shade has always been the tender substance of all my dreams, and if now the illusions I have about you grow so intense as to make me hope that my dream, young and old, might be transformed into delicious, vivid reality, then you have, in me, the most zealous and most loyal servitor, who will take it as a matter of conscience to discharge precisely and punctually all his duties.

The abuse seen in this last century, with table-turning, all kinds of mediums, hypnotism, cards, offhand palmistry, coffee grounds often harmful to the health, as in Turkey, for example, have given birth to troublesome and often exaggerated prejudices. The magician has been replaced by the fortune teller, if not by the clairvoyant. But since the magician, refusing to compete with these absurd rivals, calls for surprising combinations from science and the fine arts, concerns himself above all with hygiene, studies the raw materials, arranges them in a rational manner, since finally magic has taken on new forms in perfect harmony with good taste and reason, these prejudices have greatly diminished. They will disappear completely when creations made for the theatre and costume parties are distinguished from those destined for good company. For the former, the recipes for fast results, but too violent to endure. For the salons, the simple and suave combinations, the serious methods, which, without appearing to do so, master destiny, and which, in short, confer power and talent. Considered from this double point of view, the magician’s art merits the esteem and the interest of sensible people. I hope to show one proof of this in these recipes chosen for use by society people. It’s very easy to make. You take several fillets of sole—new shoes are not necessary, old ones being fine for this use, in fact the sole should be aged well. Take every precaution that the sole not take on your odor as you clean it—to do so, dredge your hands in flour beforehand. Cut the sole into pieces and put them in a basket in the oven. When they have lost all their moisture, grind them up in a mortar and pass the dust through a very fine sieve. Finally, mix it with a solution of horse fat. You’ll be delighted with it. It sometimes happens that such-and-such a young man— nearly a child—becomes highly successful in the salons with his metrics or with others metrics, and one would wish to do the same. Go to work for the gas company and you’ll learn all about meters; if the recipe doesn’t succeed, go to a gymnasium and learn about isometrics; and if that fails, study the metric system. Another recipe for poetry You should always carry an umbrella you never open. Revealed by M. André B., this recipe is supposed to have been entrusted to him by our dear M. P.F., prince of poets.

Beside this a very tidy looking wooden chest is placed. It looks like a long, not particularly wide drawer or counting board, and is full of clean yarn; and on the other side of the pit another such, but empty, drawer is placed. The hundred hooks attached to the yarn in the one drawer are neatly arranged on the end of a small iron pole and are now being unfastened one after the other and laid in the empty drawer, the bottom of which is filled with nothing but clean wet sand. A very tidy operation. In the meantime, however, four long, lean and strong hands oversee the process as carefully as nurses to make sure that each hook gets a worm. The men who do this crouch two by two on knees and heels, with mighty, bony backs, long, kindly faces, and pipes in their mouths. They exchange incomprehensible words that flow forth as softly as the motion of their hands. One of them takes up a fat earthworm with two fingers, tears it into three pieces with the same two fingers of the other hand, as easily and exactly as a shoemaker snips off the paper band after he’s taken the measurement; the other one then presses these squirming pieces calmly and carefully onto each hook. This having been accomplished, the worms are then doused with water and laid in neat little beds, one next to the other, in the drawer with the soft sand, where they can die without immediately losing their freshness. It is a quiet, delicate activity, whereby the coarse fishermen’s fingers step softly as on tiptoes. You have to pay close attention. In fair weather the dark blue sky arches above and the seagulls circle high over the land like white swallows.","id":366},{"author":"JUAN RAMÓN JIMÉNEZ","author_meta":"(Spain/Puerto Rico, 1881–1958)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Moon","text":"Broadway.

From room to room they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making sure—a ghostly couple. Here we left it, she said. And he added, Oh, but here too. It’s upstairs, she murmured. And in the garden, he whispered. Quietly, they said, or we shall wake them. But it wasn’t that you woke us. Oh, no. They’re looking for it; they’re drawing the curtain, one might say, and so read on a page or two. Now they’ve found it, one would be certain, stopping the pencil on the margin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open, only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm. What did I come in here for? What did I want to find? My hands were empty. Perhaps its upstairs then? The apples were in the loft. And so down again, the garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass. But they had found it in the drawing-room. Not that one could ever see them. The windowpanes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the drawing-room, the apple only turned its yellow side. Yet, the moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the floor, hung upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling—what? My hands were empty. The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound. Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat softly. The treasure buried; the room . . . the pulse stopped short. Oh, was that the buried treasure? A moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always burnt behind the glass. Death was the glass; death was between us; coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. He left it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs. Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat gladly. The Treasure yours. The wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window. The candle burns stiff and still. Wandering through the house, opening the windows, whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy. Here we slept, she says. And he adds, Kisses without number. Waking in the morning— Silver between the trees— Upstairs— In the garden— When summer came— In winter snowtime— The doors go shutting far in the distance, gently knocking like the pulse of a heart. Nearer they come; cease at the doorway. The wind falls, the rain slides silver down the glass. Our eyes darken; we hear no steps beside us; we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak. His hands shield the lantern. Look, he breathes. Sound asleep. Love upon their lips. Stooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and deeply. Long they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame stoops slightly. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy. Safe, safe, safe, the heart of the house beats proudly. Long years— he sighs. Again you found me. Here, she murmurs, sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft. Here we left our treasure— Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes. Safe! safe! safe! the pulse of the house beats wildly. Waking, I cry Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light in the heart.","id":368},{"author":"FRANZ KAFKA","author_meta":"(Austria-Hungary, 1883–1924)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Poseidon","text":"Poseidon sat at his desk, going over the accounts. The administration of all the waters gave him endless work. He could have had as many assistants as he wanted, and indeed he had quite a number, but since he took his job very seriously he insisted on going through all the accounts again himself, and so his assistants were of little help to him. It cannot be said that he enjoyed the work; he carried it out simply because it was assigned to him; indeed he had frequently applied for what he called more cheerful work, but whenever various suggestions were put to him it turned out that nothing suited him so well as his present employment. Needless to say, it was very difficult to find him another job. After all, he could not possibly be put in charge of one particular ocean. Quite apart from the fact that in this case the work involved would not be less, only more petty, the great Poseidon could hold only a superior position. And when he was offered a post unrelated to the waters, the very idea made him feel sick, his divine breath came short and his brazen chest began to heave. As a matter of fact, no one took his troubles very seriously; when a mighty man complains one must pretend to yield, however hopeless the case may seem. No one ever really considered relieving Poseidon of his position; he had been destined to be God of the Seas since time immemorial, and that was how it had to remain. What annoyed him most—and this was the chief cause of discontent with his job—was to learn of the rumors that were circulating about him; for instance, that he was constantly cruising through the waves with his trident. Instead of which here he was sitting in the depths of the world’s ocean endlessly going over the accounts, an occasional journey to Jupiter being the only interruption of the monotony, a journey moreover from which he invariably returned in a furious temper. As a result he had hardly seen the oceans, save fleetingly during his hasty ascent to Olympus, and had never really sailed upon them. He used to say that he was postponing this until the end of the world, for then there might come a quiet moment when, just before the end and having gone through the last account, he could still make a quick little tour.","id":369},{"author":"ERNST BLOCH","author_meta":"(Germany, 1885–1977)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Disappointment with Amusement","text":"One expected something different, and usually more. When it’s less, that’s annoying, but not always; it still offers something when it doesn’t really matter. Or when it’s really harmless, like a joke, which after all can also amuse when it falls flat—when it sets mountains in motion, as it were, only to bear a mouse. As happened, for example, with that scene at the circus, lots of big words, expectations ever rising. The ring was cleared and nothing less was announced than the battle steed Bucephalos. That was also the name of Alexander the Great’s personal horse. The mighty steel cable was already auspicious by which the ringmaster tried to drag the stallion into the ring. Only tried, of course; the stubborn, unseen something on the other end dragged him forward by the cable, outside, from where one could hear only stamping and angry whinnying. One, two, then three particularly brawny men came to the ringmaster’s aid, pulled expertly at the cable, in vain, could only bring the cable to a standstill. Until a fourth came along and grabbed the cable, a very heavy boxer, come to help them from the next number, and now he finally moved the cable from a standstill and pulled it ever more back. A final tug, all together, one could hear the clatter of mighty hoofs outside, triumph—and a wooden horse was visible at the end of the cable, rolled into the ring on its four wheels. The audience now laughed with relief at this great sight gag, laughed wholeheartedly, as we like to say. And not at all so disappointed at such a Bucephalos at the end of the tether. Even objectively, it was rather relieved by the humor, perhaps also because anticipation is not only joyful, but much more often fearful—and look, there was nothing to it. At least not in fairy tales; or even when something less childish comes, does not come out like a wooden horse, nevertheless fairy tales, the circus, all the way up to farce, all mean that the soup is always cooler when you eat it than when it was boiling.

Strength lies in improvisation. All the decisive blows are struck left-handed. At the beginning of the long downhill lane that leads to the house of———, whom I visited each evening, is a gate. After she moved, the opening of its archway henceforth stood before me like an ear that has lost the power of hearing. A child in his nightshirt cannot be prevailed upon to greet an arriving visitor. Those present, invoking a higher moral standpoint, admonish him in vain to overcome his prudery. A few minutes later he reappears, now stark naked, before the visitor. In the meantime he has washed. The power of a country road when one is walking along it is different from the power it has when one is flying over it by airplane. In the same way, the power of a text when it is read is different from the power it has when it is copied out. The airplane passenger sees only how the road pushes through the landscape, how it unfolds according to the same laws as the terrain surrounding it. Only he who walks the road on foot learns of the power it commands, and of how, from the very scenery that for the flier is only the unfurled plain, it calls forth distances, belvederes, clearings, prospects at each of its turns like a commander deploying soldiers at a front. Only the copied text thus commands the soul of him who is occupied with it, whereas the mere reader never discovers the new aspects of his inner self that are opened by the text, that road cut through the interior jungle forever closing behind it, because the reader follows the movement of his mind in the free flight of daydreaming, whereas the copier submits it to command. The Chinese practice of copying books was thus an incomparable guarantee of literary culture, and the transcript a key to China’s enigmas.","id":372},{"author":"JOSEPH ROTH","author_meta":"(Austria, 1894–1939)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Rest While Watching the Demolition","text":"Opposite the bistro where I’ve been sitting all day, an old building is being pulled down, a hotel I’ve lived in these past sixteen years—apart from such time as I was away on my travels. Yesterday one wall, the back wall, was still standing, awaiting its final night. The three other walls were already rubble, on the half-fenced-off site. How oddly small the site seemed to me, compared to the big hotel that had formerly occupied the same space. You would have thought, too, that an empty site would appear bigger than one that was built on. But probably it’s the sixteen years, now that they’re over, seeming so precious to me, so full of precious things, that I can’t understand how they could have elapsed in such a small space. And because the hotel is shattered and the years I lived in it have gone, it seems bigger in memory, much bigger than it can have been. On the one remaining wall I could still see the wallpaper in my room, which was sky blue with a fine gold pattern. Then, yesterday, they put up a scaffolding against the wall, and two workers climbed up on it. With pickax and sledgehammer they attacked my wallpaper, my wall; and then, when it was reeling and decrepit, the men tied ropes round the wall—the wall was to be put to death. The workers climbed down, dismantling the scaffolding as they went. The two ends of the rope hung down on either side of the wall. Each man took hold of one end and pulled. And with a crash the wall came down. Everything was obscured by a dense white cloud of plaster dust and mortar. From it emerged, all coated in white dust, like great millers who grind stones, the two men. They made straight for me, as they had been doing twice each day. They’ve known me since I’ve been sitting here. The younger one gestures back over his shoulder with his thumb, and says, It’s gone now, your wall! I asked them both to stop and have a drink with me, more as if they’d been building me a wall. We joked about the wallpaper, the walls, my precious years. The workers were demolition men; knocking things down was their job; they would never think of building anything. And quite right too! they said. Everyone does the job they do, and gets paid the going rate! And this man here is the king of the demolition men, said the younger one. The older one smiled. That’s how cheerful the destroyers were, and I with them. Now I’m sitting facing the vacant lot, and hearing the hours go by. You lose one home after another, I say to myself. Here I am, sitting with my wanderer’s staff. My feet are sore, my heart is tired, my eyes are dry. Misery crouches beside me, ever larger and ever gentler; pain takes an interest, becomes huge and kind; terror flutters up, and it doesn’t even frighten me anymore. And that’s the most desolate thing of all. Unimaginable things happen, and the hand remains calm and doesn’t clutch at the head. On my right is the little post office; the postman comes out and delivers my letters, bad letters mostly; when the hotel was still standing, he used to leave good letters on my table. A woman comes—one I used to love, and I smile, a shadow of an old smile I used to have, that I no longer miss. An old man shuffles by, wearing a pair of indoor slippers, and I envy him his shuffle and his being an old man. Boisterous customers stand around the bar, arguing. There is a series of unresolvable, albeit not-very-far-reaching differences of opinion between them on such matters as cigarette lighters, radios, racehorses, wives, makes of car, aperitifs, and other such weighty issues. A taxi driver walks in. The waiter brings him a glass of red wine. His taxi’s waiting. The driver drinks his wine. Soon he’s quite alone, facing the landlady across the bar. The waiter balances an empty can on a car tire. The guests laugh. They want me to laugh with them. Why not? I stand up, and I laugh. Who’s that laughing in me? I’ve got misery waiting at my table, large, gentle misery. I won’t be long, I’m just laughing! Diagonally across from me is the barber, standing in front of his door, as white as a candle. Soon his customers will arrive, they will arrive at the end of their day’s work, when the newspaper seller comes and brings me the evening papers, the ones that are full of heated skirmishes and cold blood, and that yet—one can’t really believe it—flop rustling home on to the tables on the terrace like huge, exhausted peace doves at the end of their day. All the terror of the world is in them, all the terror of the whole grisly day, that’s what makes them so tired. When the first silvery streetlights glimmer on, a refugee, an exile, sometimes comes along, without a wanderer’s staff, quite as if he were at home here, and—as if he wanted to prove to me in one breath that he felt at home, that he knew his way around, but also that where he felt at home wasn’t home—he says: I know somewhere you can get a good, cheap meal here. And I’m glad for him that he does. I’m glad that he walks off under the trail of silvery streetlights, and doesn’t stop, now that night is falling, to take in the ever-ghost-lier-looking dust on the empty lot opposite. Not everyone has to get used to rubble and to shattered walls. The exile, the displaced person, has taken the newspapers away with him. He wants to read them in his good, cheap restaurant. In front of me the table is empty.","id":373},{"author":"JAMES THURBER","author_meta":"(United States, 1894–1961)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Variations on the Theme","text":"A fox, attracted by the scent of something, followed his nose to a tree in which sat a crow with a piece of cheese in his beak.

I submit this cheese in evidence, as Exhibit A, and bid you and the criminal a very good day. Whereupon he lit a cigarette and strolled away. In the great and ancient tradition, the crow in the tree with the cheese in his beak began singing, and the cheese fell into the fox’s lap. You sing like a shovel, said the fox, with a grin, but the crow pretended not to hear and cried out, Quick, give me back the cheese! Here comes the farmer with his rifle! Why should I give you back the cheese? the wily fox demanded. Because the farmer has a gun, and I can fly faster than you can run. So the frightened fox tossed the cheese back to the crow, who ate it, and said, Dearie me, my eyes are playing tricks on me or am I playing tricks on you? Which do you think?

Old men rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. Young men danced with her at frolics when they should have been dancing with their grown-up girls. God grant us youth, secretly prayed the old men. The young fellows counted the time to pass before she would be old enough to mate with them. This interest of the male, who wishes to ripen a growing thing too soon, could mean no good to her. Karintha, at twelve, was a wild flash that told the other folks just what it was to live. At sunset, when there was no wind, and the pine-smoke from over by the sawmill hugged the earth, and you couldn’t see more than a few feet in front, her sudden darting past you was a bit of vivid color, like a black bird that flashes in light. With the other children one could hear, some distance off, their feet flopping in the two-inch dust. Karintha’s running was a whir. It had the sound of the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road. At dusk, during the hush just after the sawmill had closed down, and before any of the women had started their supper-getting-ready songs, her voice, high-pitched, shrill, would put one’s ears to itching. But no one ever thought to make her stop because of it. She stoned the cows, and beat her dog, and fought the other children . . . Even the preacher, who caught her at her mischief, told himself that she was as innocently lovely as a November cotton flower. Already, rumors were out about her. Homes in Georgia are most often built on the two-room plan. In one, you cook and eat, in the other you sleep, and there love goes on. Karintha had seen or heard, perhaps she had felt her parents loving. One could but imitate one’s parents, for to follow them was the way of God. She played home with a small boy who was not afraid to do her bidding. That started the whole thing. Old men could no longer ride her hobby-horse upon their knees. But young men counted faster. Karintha is a woman. She who carries beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. She has been married many times. Old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. Karintha smiles, and indulges them when she is in the mood for it. She has contempt for them. Karintha is a woman. Young men run stills to make her money. Young men go to the big cities and run on the road. Young men go away to college. They all want to bring her money.

Meanwhile, the smoke curls up and hangs in odd wraiths about the trees, curls up, and spreads itself out over the valley. . .

A joy to behold. At the party I thought, the ladies would be throwing themselves at me. I should admit, I’m fanatical about cleanliness.

Some kind of tiny shirt, the collar wouldn’t fit and the cuffs were where the elbows had been. What the hell was going on? I quickly hurried back to the laundry woman. The laundry woman said: That’s nothing unusual. It’s only to be expected. New shirts these days always shrink. Either it’s the material they’re made from or the manufacturers don’t wash the fabric. That’s nothing. What do you mean nothing! It won’t fit round my neck. It used to be, I said, size 38, and now it’s probably a 32.

The accountant threatened to smash my face in for that, but it’s not my fault. Damn it! What, I thought, can I do? And I didn’t have much time. It was time to go to the party.

Do not speak to me of economics, that is merely a question of how we arrange matters between us. And do not speak to me of genesis: I am discussing the question of Mrs. Paradise and Mr. Babcock and myself and the others as immediate causes of one another, I am not discussing creation. Personally, I do not believe in creation. Creation is stealing one thing to turn it into another. What I am discussing is existence, uncorrupted by art—how came it about, and so forth. Do not speak to me of love: Mrs. Paradise and Mr. Babcock and myself and all the others do not like each other, in fact, we dislike each other because each of us is most certainly the cause of the other. I am the reason for Mrs. Paradise’s making frocks and Mrs. Paradise is the reason for my wearing frocks. If it were not for each other we should be occupied only with ourselves; we should not exist. How then came we to exist? I ask this question. Mrs. Paradise asks this question. I am Mrs. Paradise’s answer. Mrs. Paradise is my answer. As for Mr. Babcock, he has hair on his nose and I never look at him. As for all the others, I must put up a notice asking them to ring the bell gently. There is a woman in this city who loathes me. There are people everywhere who loathe me. I could name them; if they were in a book I could turn to the exact page. People who loathe me do so for one of two reasons: because I have frightened them because I have loathed them that is, made my death-face at them, which I shall not describe as it might in this way lose some of its virtue or because they are interested in me and there seems no practical way of or excuse for satisfying their interest. As to love, that is another matter—it has nothing to do with either interest or fear. Love is simply a matter of history, beginning like cancer from small incidents. There is nothing further to be said about it. But as to loathing: I feel an intense intimacy with those who have this loathing interest in me. Further than this, I know what they mean, I sympathize with them, I understand them. There should be a name as poetic as love for this relationship between loather and loathed; it is of the closest and more full of passion than incest. To continue about this woman. What is to her irritation is to me myself. She has therefore a very direct sense of me, as I have a very direct sense of her, from being a kind of focus of her nervous system. There is no sentiment, no irony between us, nothing but feeling: it is an utterly serious relationship. For if one eat my meat, though it be known The meat was mine, the excrement is his own. I forget in what context these words were used by Donne—but they express very accurately how organic I feel this relationship to be. The tie between us is as positive as the tie between twins is negative. I think of her often. She is a painter—not a very good painter. I understand this too: it is difficult to explain, but quite clear to myself that one of the reasons I am attached to her is that she is not a good painter. Also her clothes, which do not fit her well: this again makes me even more attached to her. If she knew this she would be exasperated against me all the more, and I should like it; not because I want to annoy her but because this would make our relationship still more intense. It would be terrible to me if we ever became friends; like a divorce.","id":382},{"author":"LUIS CERNUDA","author_meta":"(Spain, 1902–1963)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Teacher","text":"I had him for a class in rhetoric, and he was short, chubby, with glasses like the ones Schubert wears in his portraits, walking through the cloisters in small slow strides, breviary in hand or with his hands resting in his cloak pockets, cap pushed well back on his large head with its thick gray hair. Nearly always quiet, or when paired with another professor speaking in measured tones, his voice strong and resonant, but most of the time alone in his cell, where he kept a few secular books mixed in with the religious ones, and from which I could see in springtime the green leaves and dark fruit of a mulberry tree climbing the wall and covering the gloomy little patio his window opened on. One day in class he tried to read us some verses, his voice aglow with heartfelt enthusiasm, and it must have been hard for him to understand the mockery, veiled at first, then open and hostile, of the students—because he admired poetry and its art, in a pedantic way, naturally. It was he who tried to get me to recite sometimes, although a shyness stronger than pleasure froze my delivery; he who encouraged me to write my first poems, critiquing them then and giving me as an esthetic precept what in my literary papers would always be a graceful hold on the material. He put me at the head of the class, a distinction for which I soon paid with a certain unpopularity among my schoolmates, and before final exams, as if understanding my diffidence and lack of confidence, he told me, Go to the chapel and pray. That will give you courage. Once I got to the university, in my self-absorption I stopped going to see him. One deep gold morning in fall, on my way to my early first class, I saw a poor little funeral turning the corner, the red brick wall of the school, which I’d forgotten; it was his.

Everyone knows in advance the precise mechanism of events. Family memories, felicitations and forecasts roll out like newspapers from presses. Old habits must be cast off to escape this monotony. There are a thousand ways to revitalize this occasion: here is one which we put to the test with the Futursimultaneists in Rome: Mattia, Belli, D’Avila, Pandolfo, Battistella, Vignazia, etc. At midnight after the endless chit-chat of waiting it is announced that dinner is served. In the dining room the tables have been removed and the guests are seated on chairs placed in a row, Indian file, one behind the other. The inevitable turkey arrives, served by the waiters on metal plates: the turkey is stuffed with mandarins and salami. Everyone eats in compulsory silence: the desire for noise and jollity is suppressed. Then suddenly a live turkey is let loose in the room, and it flounders about in terror, to the surprise of the men and the squeals of the women who can’t understand this resurrection of the food they’ve just eaten. Order is reestablished and everyone puts away his momentarily uncontained joy. Beaten by the silence, in an attempt to start any sort of conversation one of those present says: I haven’t yet expressed my good wishes for the New Year. Then as if following an order they all jump up and hurl themselves against the unwary conservator of tradition, whom they pummel repeatedly. Finally, happiness, exasperated by too much inaction, explodes and the guests disperse about the house, the most daring invading the kitchen. The cook and two waiters are removed by force and everyone sets to thinking up a way of varying the meal. A fierce competition between the hot ovens, while frying pans and saucepans pass from hand to hand amidst laughter, shouts and a rain of ingredients. Meanwhile others have discovered the wine cellar and thus an exceptional banquet is put together, which goes from kitchen to bedroom, from entrance hall to bathroom, to cellar. The dishes, put together almost by magic, follow one upon the other in the spirit of speed and harmony that animates the new cooks. A guest tells the owner of the house: Fifteen years ago, on this same date . . . But that same moment he is presented with a bowl full of spumante with cauliflowers, slices of lemon and roast beef floating in it: the memory of the past is shipwrecked in a stunning present. The youngest guests shout: Bury your memories. We must start the year in a quite different way from the pre-war banquets! Three gramophones function as tables and from on top of the records, which have become rotating plates, people pluck little sugar-coated candies, cylinders of Parmesan cheese and hard-boiled eggs, while three different rhythms of Japanese music accompany the dynamic service. The owner of the house suddenly turns out the lights. Stupefaction. In the darkness the voice of one of the guests is heard: This year we will succeed in breaking through the envelope of the atmosphere and reach the planets. I invite you all to a banquet next New Year’s Eve on the moon, where we will finally taste foods of a flavour unknown to our palates and unimaginable drinks!","id":385},{"author":"DANIIL KHARMS","author_meta":"(Russia, 1905–1942)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"NO-TITLE","text":"At two o’clock on Nevsky Prospect, or rather on the Avenue of October 25th, nothing of note occurred.

It was the period of my first marriage. We lived in an old gambrel house, built about 1740, on top of a ridge called Wormwood Hill. I had bought the house, together with more than 100 acres of woodland and pasture, for $500 down. It had no electricity, no heat, no running water, and it was in bad repair, but it was a great, beautiful house. I spent most of three years, working with my hands, making it habitable. At that time early American art and furniture were practically being given away. Poor as we were, we managed to fill the house with priceless stuff. We were so far from the city and from all signs of progress that we might as well have been living in another age. One spring there appeared on the road, climbing up the hill, a man in a patchwork suit, with a battered silk hat on his head. His trousers and swallow-tail coat had been mended so many times, with varicolored swatches, that when he approached us, over the brow of the hill, he looked like a crazyquilt on stilts. He was an itinerant tinker, dried-out and old, thin as a scarecrow, with a high, cracked voice. He asked for pots and pans to repair, scissors and knives to sharpen. In the shade of the sugar maples, that a colonel in Washington’s army was said to have planted, he set up his shop and silently went to work on the articles I handed to him. When he was done, I offered him lunch in the kitchen. He would not sit down to eat, but accepted some food in a bag. I have been here before, he said to me quietly. On our way out, while we were standing in the front hall at the foot of the staircase, he suddenly cried, I hear the worms tumbling in this house. What do you mean? I asked. He did not answer, but cupped his hands over his eyes. I took it as a bad omen, a fateful prophecy, about my house, my marriage. And so it turned out to be. Some time later I learned that my visitor was a legendary figure, known throughout the countryside as the Old Darned Man. He had been a brilliant divinity student at Yale, engaged to a childhood sweetheart, with the wedding set for the day after graduation. But on that very day, while he waited at the church, the news was brought to him that she had run off with his dearest friend. Ever since then he had been wandering distractedly from village to village in his wedding clothes. As for the worms, they belonged to a forgotten page in local history. Late in the nineteenth century the housewives of the region, dreaming of a fortune to be made, had started a cottage industry in silkworm culture, importing the worms from China. The parlors of every farmhouse were lined with stacks of silkworm trays, in which the worms munched on mulberry leaves, making clicking and whispering noises. That was the sound heard in my hall. It’s a story without a happy ending. The worms died; the dreams of riches faded; abandoned plows rusted in the farmyards; one breathless summer day a black-funneled twister wheeled up Wormwood Hill from the stricken valley, dismantling my house, my barn, my grove of sugar maples; the face of my bride darkened and broke into a wild laughter; I never saw the Old Darned Man again.","id":387},{"author":"SAMUEL BECKETT","author_meta":"(Ireland/France, 1906–1989)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"One Evening","text":"He was found lying on the ground. No one had missed him. No one was looking for him. An old woman found him. To put it vaguely. It happened so long ago. She was straying in search of wild flowers. Yellow only. With no eyes but for these she stumbled on him lying there. He lay face downward and arms outspread. He wore a greatcoat in spite of the time of year. Hidden by the body a long row of buttons fastened it all the way down. Buttons of all shapes and sizes. Worn upright the skirts swept the ground. That seems to hang together. Near the head a hat lay askew on the ground. At once on its brim and crown. He lay inconspicuous in the greenish coat. To catch an eye searching from afar there was only the white head. May she have seen him somewhere before? Somewhere on his feet before? Not too fast. She was all in black. The hem of her long black skirt trailed in the grass. It was close of day. Should she now move away into the east her shadow would go before. A long black shadow. It was lambing time. But there were no lambs. She could see none. Were a third party to chance that way theirs were the only bodies he would see. First that of the old woman standing. Then on drawing near it lying on the ground. That seems to hang together. The deserted fields. The old woman all in black stock-still. The body stockstill on the ground. Yellow at the end of the black arm. The white hair in the grass. The east foundering in night. Not too fast. The weather. Sky overcast all day till evening. In the west-north-west near the verge already the sun came out at last. Rain? A few drops if you will. A few drops in the morning if you will. In the present to conclude. It happened so long ago. Cooped indoors all day she comes out with the sun. She makes haste to gain the fields. Surprised to have seen no one on the way she strays feverishly in search of the wild flowers. Feverishly seeing the imminence of night. She remarks with surprise the absence of lambs in great numbers here at this time of year. She is wearing the black she took on when widowed young. It is to reflower the grave she strays in search of the flowers he had loved. But for the need of yellow at the end of the black arm there would be none. There are therefore only as few as possible. This is for her the third surprise since she came out. For they grow in plenty here at this time of year. Her old friend her shadow irks her. So much so that she turns to face the sun. Any flower wide of her course she reaches sidelong. She craves for sundown to end and to stray freely again in the long after-glow. Further to her distress the familiar rustle of her long black skirt in the grass. She moves with half-closed eyes as if drawn on into the glare. She may say to herself it is too much strangeness for a single March or April evening. No one abroad. Not a single lamb. Scarcely a flower. Shadow and rustle irksome. And to crown all the shock of her foot against a body. Chance. No one had missed him. No one was looking for him. Black and green of the garments touching now. Near the white head the yellow of the few plucked flowers. The old sunlit face. Tableau vivant if you will. In its way. All is silent from now on. For as long as she cannot move.

He would take long walks at night, disappearing among thick cypresses, which, however, could be easily approached by the swift stars. Or he would stir up a mistral with the cumbersome presence of his easel, his palette and his wild bundles of canvases. Thus saddled, he packed himself off to the vicinity of Montmajour, a ruin known for its perils. Arles and Les Baux, the country threading toward the Rhone, were also the settings for meanderings and sudden spurts of work by a vaguely suspicious artist, if you judged by his eyes and his red bristle without grasping the truth. It was only later that a smokescreen of explanations was hurled forth about him, This frequenter of the brothel of Arles was in fact a decent man, who was taken in a demented state to the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole just a few hundred yards from Glanum, then still a buried city, but hinted at by a cradle-shaped arc, which van Gogh had painted with the utmost skill in one of his works. I understood, in looking at his drawings, that he had up to that time worked, and only for us. And why not add to this story something which occurred in another space and time? This countryside, down to the belly of its grasshoppers, was fully communicated to us by a hand and a wrist. From what cauldron and from what paradise did Vincent van Gogh surge? From what great suffering did he produce those pebbles, those irises and those marshes, those narrow roads, those farms, that wheat, those vines, that river? Sublime work. In another century, locked behind the iron bars of several misfortunes, my own life tracked me down in a similar terrain! I realized this and tried to barter with Vincent’s profound vision, but while his eyes were enriched by their truth, their novel flowers, mine were wounded, not gladdened, by melting snow.

Finally! The tree bursts with grenade. The rock explodes. Tenderness, now and then this great repose. Tenderness: now and then this orchestra playing and intertwining steps like plaited wicker. Tenderness, but that of adorable tortures: the setting in motion of a fire of bit-braces which drill and force the void to scream star. It is blood. Moreover it is hard to understand how it is enough to feed the extraordinary devolution of horses which from ridge to ridge turn back on the momentum of the ravines. No more monarchy. And it is perpetual this invention of ecstatic chants, of abbreviated prayers, of meticulous spider ceremonials, of saws which splash about, of unknotted hair, of enameled glass mosque lamps which collide, of seas which flow and ebb, of an alembic, of worms which at full steam trumpet unforgettable condensations. Unforgettable indeed. An assagai dance the likes of which has never been seen and ten thousand victory flags torn from the cetaceans and waved by the earth. The vineyard of wrath has peddled to the very sky the alcohol of its repose and its salvation.","id":395},{"author":"DAVID IGNATOW","author_meta":"(United States, 1914–1997)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Diner","text":"If I order a sandwich and get a plate of ham and eggs instead, has communication broken down?

He would order a cup of coffee, light a cigarette, listen to the chatter, sip his coffee, pay the waiter, take his hat, grab his case, say good afternoon, and leave. And so it was every day. What did don Pedro say upon sitting and rising, with serious face and hard eyes? He said, Don Pedro repeated the phrase many times each day. Upon rising, upon completing his morning preparations, upon entering and leaving his house—at eight o’clock, at one, at two-thirty, at seven-forty—in the café, in the office, before and after every meal, when going to bed each night. He repeated it between his teeth or in a loud voice, alone or with others. Sometimes with only his eyes. Always with all his soul. No one knew to whom he addressed these words. Everyone ignored the origin of his hate. When someone wanted to dig deeper into the story, don Pedro would turn his head with disdain and fall silent, modest. Perhaps it was a causeless hate, a pure hate. But the feeling nourished him, gave seriousness to his life, majesty to his years. Dressed in black, he seemed to be prematurely mourning for his victim. One afternoon don Pedro arrived graver than usual. He sat down heavily, and, in the center of the silence that was created by his presence, he simply dropped these words: Who and how? Some smiled, wanting to the take the thing as a joke. Don Pedro’s look stopped them. All of us felt uncomfortable. That sense of the void of death was certain. Slowly the group dispersed. Don Pedro remained alone, more serious than ever, a little withered, like a burnt-out star, but tranquil, without remorse. He did not return the next day. He never returned. Did he die? Maybe he needed that life-giving hate. Maybe he still lives and now hates another. I examine my actions, and advise you to do the same. Perhaps you too have incurred the same obstinate, patient anger of those small myopic eyes.

As though to an enchanted castle, all roads to it are barred and over each one hangs a forbidding sign—a plain, blunt straight line. Man or beast, faced by that sign, must turn back. Some earthly power has put that sign there; past it none may ride, none may walk, crawl, or even fly. Guards with swords and pistols lurk beside the path in the nearby pine grove. You may circle and circle the silent wood searching for a way through to the lake, but you will find none and there will be no one to ask, for no one goes into this wood. They have all been frightened away. Your only chance to venture through will be one afternoon in the rain along a cattle track, in the wake of the dull clink of a cowbell. And from your first glimpse of it, vast and shimmering between the tree trunks, you know before you reach its banks that you will be in thrall to this place for the rest of your life. Segden Lake is as round as though traced out with a pair of compasses. If you were to shout from one side but you must not shout, or you will be heard, only a fading echo would reach the other bank. It is a long way across. Woods immure the lakeside entirely, a dense forest of row upon unbroken row of trees. As you come out of the wood to the water’s edge, you can see the whole of the forbidden shore, here a strip of yellow sand, there a grey stubble of reeds, there a lush swathe of grass. The water is smooth, calm, and unruffled, and apart from some patches of weed by the shore, the white lake bed gleams through the translucent water. A secret lake in a secret forest. The water looks up and the sky gazes down upon it. If there is a world beyond the forest, it is unknown, invisible; if it exists, it has no place here. Here is somewhere to settle forever, a place where a man could live in harmony with the elements and be inspired. But it cannot be. An evil prince, a squint-eyed villain, has claimed the lake for his own: there is his house, there is his bathing place. His evil brood goes fishing here, shoots duck from his boat. First a wisp of blue smoke above the lake, then a moment later the shot. Away beyond the woods, the people sweat and heave, whilst all the roads leading here are closed lest they intrude. Fish and game are bred for the villain’s pleasure.

Another possible title would be The Killing. Or even How to Kill Cockroaches. So I shall tell at least three stories, all of them true, because none of the three will contradict the others. Although they constitute one story, they could become a thousand and one, were I to be granted a thousand and one nights. The first story, How To Kill Cockroaches, begins like this, I was complaining about the cockroaches. A woman heard me complain. She gave me a recipe for killing them. I was to mix together equal quantities of sugar, flour and gypsum. The flour and sugar would attract the cockroaches, the gypsum would dry up their insides. I followed her advice. The cockroaches died. The next story is really the first, and it is called The Killing. It begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches. A woman heard me complain. The recipe follows. And then the killing takes place. The truth is that I had only complained in abstract terms about the cockroaches, for they were not even mine: they belonged to the ground floor and climbed up the pipes in the building into our apartment. It was only when I prepared the mixture that they also became mine. On our behalf, therefore, I began to measure and weigh ingredients with greater concentration. A vague loathing had taken possession of me, a sense of outrage. By day, the cockroaches were invisible and no one would believe in the evil secret which eroded such a tranquil household. But if the cockroaches, like evil secrets, slept by day, there I was preparing their nightly poison. Meticulous, eager, I prepared the elixir of prolonged death. An angry fear and my own evil secret guided me. Now I coldly wanted one thing only: to kill every cockroach in existence. Cockroaches climb up the pipes while weary people sleep. And now the recipe was ready, looking so white. As if I were dealing with cockroaches as cunning as myself, I carefully spread the powder until it looked like part of the surface dust. From my bed, in the silence of the apartment, I imagined them climbing up one by one into the kitchen where darkness slept, a solitary towel alert on the clothes-line. I awoke hours later, startled at having overslept. It was beginning to grow light. I walked across the kitchen. There they lay on the floor of the scullery, huge and brittle. During the night I had killed them. On our behalf, it was beginning to grow light. On a nearby hill, a cockerel crowed. The third story which now begins is called The Statues. It begins by saying that I had been complaining about the cockroaches. Then the same woman appears on the scene. And so it goes on to the point where I awake as it is beginning to grow light, and I awake still feeling sleepy and I walk across the kitchen. Even more sleepy is the scullery floor with its tiled perspective. And in the shadows of dawn, there is a purplish hue which distances everything; at my feet, I perceive patches of light and shade, scores of rigid statues scattered everywhere. The cockroaches that have hardened from core to shell. Some are lying upside down. Others arrested in the midst of some movement that will never be completed. In the mouths of some of the cockroaches, there are traces of white powder. I am the first to observe the dawn breaking over Pompei. I know what this night has been, I know about the orgy in the dark. In some, the gypsum has hardened as slowly as in some organic process, and the cockroaches, with ever more tortuous movements, have greedily intensified the night’s pleasures, trying to escape from their insides. Until they turn to stone, in innocent terror and with such, but such an expression of pained reproach. Others— suddenly assailed by their own core, without even having perceived that their inner form was turning to stone.—these are suddenly crystallized, just like a word arrested on someone’s lips: I love . . . The cockroaches, invoking the name of love in vain, sang on a summer’s night. While the cockroach over there, the one with the brown antennae smeared with white, must have realized too late that it had become mummified precisely because it did not know how to use things with the gratuitous grace of the in vain: It is just that I looked too closely inside myself! it is just that I looked too closely inside . . .—from my frigid height as a human being, I watch the destruction of a world. Dawn breaks. Here and there, the parched antennae of dead cockroaches quiver in the breeze. The cockerel from the previous story crows. The fourth story opens a new era in the household. The story begins as usual: I was complaining about the cockroaches. It goes on up to the point when I see the statues in plaster of Paris. Inevitably dead. I look towards the pipes where this same night an infestation will reappear, swarming slowly upwards in Indian file. Should I renew the lethal sugar every night? like someone who no longer sleeps without the avidity of some rite. And should I take myself somnambulant out to the terrace early each morning? in my craving to encounter the statues which my perspiring night has erected. I trembled with depraved pleasure at the vision of my double existence as a witch. I also trembled at the sight of that hardening gypsum, the depravity of existence which would shatter my internal form. The grim moment of choosing between two paths, which I thought would separate, convinced that any choice would mean sacrificing either myself or my soul. I chose. And today I secretly carry a plaque of virtue in my heart: This house has been disinfected. The fifth story is called Leibnitz and The Transcendence of Love in Polynesia. . . It begins like this: I was complaining about the cockroaches.","id":400},{"author":"AUGUSTO MONTERROSO","author_meta":"(Guatemala, 1921–2003)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Errata and Final Notice","text":"Somewhere on page 45 a comma is missing, omitted consciously or unconsciously by the typesetter who failed to include it on that day, at that time, on that machine; any imbalance this error may cause in the world is his responsibility.

When the religious wars broke out, he had hoped it was a question—he was a foreigner in that country and practiced another religion—of the customary depravities to which that region’s inhabitants were inclined, all of them sanguineous of dying in some noisy and exhibitionistic way, and of killing others with particular cruelty. He bore no love for that country, where he lived as the secretary to the ambassador of another country, where wars of religion were not waged. His country fought atheistic wars, scientifically based. At the moment when the wars of religion had broken out, the secretary had been unable to return to his native land, where a ferocious scientific war was then underway, a war concerned, at least in origin, with hexagons and acids, but which bit by bit had then expanded to the inclusion of nearly all the disciplines, with the sole exclusion of ancient history. Now, the secretary, whom you see in sober dress, has been said, in generic terms, to practice another religion, but there is also the possibility that he practices none at all. What his country most respects is allegiance to ideals upon scientific bases; he himself, however, has no great love of science, and if he had to choose a field in which to specialize, ancient history would be his choice. But since this is the only non-controversial subject, choosing it would have been regarded as suspect, and derided as cowardly. He would have been put to death. Fortuitously, the outbreak of the religious war had allowed him to give no response to requests for clarification that had come from his homeland, but at the very same time he had definitively exiled himself in the country of religious wars. For years he had ventured no more than a few dozen yards from his cellar; he was probably the only foreigner left in a country where massacre was pandemic, and becoming pedantic; a country that no longer had cities, but picturesque expanses of ruins awaiting the death of the last combatant, so as then to grow ivy-covered and be transported into History. Though he had never admitted it in so many words, he liked to live in that territory precisely for its being the theater of a war that was alien to him. So History was none of his doing, but was something perceived as a rumble to which he had grown accustomed; as a lover of ancient history and dead languages, he too looked forward to living—as had always been his dream—in a country made only and entirely of ruins among grasses that have no history.","id":402},{"author":"ITALO CALVINO","author_meta":"(Italy, 1923–1985)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Nero and Bertha","text":"This particular Bertha was a poor woman who did nothing but spin, being a skillful spinner.

But you write a libretto and then let’s just see if you’d prefer to have it set or not. I’d like Marcello to set it, and Ronconi to direct it, and for there to be simultaneous performances outdoors above the Canal in Venice and at the Metropolitan Opera. That’s what I want. When I heard my wife’s voice on the telephone, calling me in Venice from New York City, I knew that someone must have died. We didn’t phone each other now about ordinary things. Venice. The cemetery. Walking around. Arm in arm, sometimes. Occasionally, hand in hand. Her eyes look up. His look down. They look down together. A grave. Evening. Later. The shine of plates. The smile of knives and of forks. Hotel. Stone balcony. Opposite church. Great big faces. Almost in the room. Stone they stare at them with their own face. And yet since it is Carnival he and she put on masks. One red mask his. One black mask hers. This is happiness. There is no other. Cold water faucet. A slight pain in the chest. She takes. Opposite church. To miss what massive. Increasing silence. Man at the desk. Woman at the desk. Dream band. Marchers off the street. Canal-side restaurant. No more eels. Isthmuses of islands. I have. I have a reason. I have a reason to be sad. Here is a reason to be joyful. A grass turf. A striped day. But, most of all, this girl. It became what it began to be, a cemetery. An island dedicated to the dead. Black were the gondolas in the canals, and black the clothing that the gondoliers wore. Black were the buttons on the coat that he did not put on, to go out, because it was spring. Black were the steps on the stairway when he first came to them, blinded by the sun. And then his body went off. Again said Marcello, I said I won’t set it and I won’t. It’s too complicated. A librettist in writing should seek only to inspire the writing of music. You haven’t done that. I have more friends than you, Marcello, I said. Ah, but they don’t set libretti, Marcello said. But if I don’t set it, of course you are free to give it to someone else. But here. Let me look at it one last time. At this point I woke up. The complicated dream was at an end.

Here on its back is the oil that heats our houses so efficiently. Wind blows fine sand back toward the ocean. The flipper near me lies folded over the stomach, looking like an unfinished arm, lightly glazed with sand at the edges. The other flipper lies half underneath.

He’s a quarter mile farther up the shore. Today he is thinner, squatting on his stomach, head out. The ribs show much more: each vertebra on the back under the coat is visible, shiny.

Old Bud Romick sags still on the porch swing. The rusty chains do their best for his body in the dark. The dark turns around him, a stain like the bruise on a plum somebody somehow missed and left under a leaf. His two hellions have long since giggled their way upstairs. Old Bud Romick is talking lightly in his sleep, and an evening shower brings him a sticky new sycamore leaf in his sleep. Whether or not he is aware of leaves, I don’t know. I don’t know whether or not he is aware of anything touching his face. Whether or not he dreams of how slender sycamores are, how slender young women are when they walk beneath the trees without caring how green they are, how lucky a plum might be if it dies without being eaten, I don’t know.","id":411},{"author":"GAEL TURNBULL","author_meta":"(Scotland, 1928–2004)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"NO-TITLE","text":"In the corner of a railway station he notices a young couple sleeping, their heads on their rucksacks, while the commuters hurry past and the taxis sound nearby. They appear to be students and he remembers his own youth, the hitch-hiking, the overnight buses, the post war cafés, his digs, the girls for whom he yearned, his incoherence, his shame, even the occasional moments of camaraderie or happiness, piercing him even yet by their intensity and brevity. Search though he may, he can find nothing durable for which he might have nostalgia, until it comes to him: their ability to sleep, curled up oblivious, while the world crashes forward about their ears. A man stands waving goodbye to his grandson as a train pulls out of a station, the same from which he left when he had come to visit his own grandfather at the same age, now a lifetime away. Indeed, he has no articulate memory of his grandfather who died shortly after, and certainly none of that last goodbye. This had always been a sorrow, that so poignant a moment should be gone for ever. But as he walks up into the town, he feels no loss at the realisation that his own grandson might scarcely remember, perhaps not at all, and so becomes aware of his grandfather in another way, more intense than any memory, more intense even than the image of that little boy waving to him through the still receding window. A woman has devoted her life to her family. One evening at the table as her husband talks of his day at work and the children of their friends at school, she picks up her half finished meal and turns it over on its face, carefully pressing it down onto the tablecloth. The children stare open mouthed. Her husband finally gasps, What are you doing? She smiles at him sadly, shaking her head. You understand nothing. It wasn’t me who did that. The woman who did that, by doing it, no longer exists.","id":412},{"author":"FIELDING DAWSON","author_meta":"(United States, 1930–2002)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Double Vision—The Rewrite","text":"A fat man in a plaid suit walked west on 23rd Street, passing the quiet bar where Ritter sat, drink in hand.

Those few but perfectly selected notes have the real epiphanic glow. The what? The real epiphanic glow, such as is obtained only by artists of the caliber of Hokie Mokie, who’s from Pass Christian, Mississippi. He’s the king of jazz, now that Spicy MacLammermoor is gone.

Yes, it was Fat Man Jones, and he began to play even before he was fully in the door. You mean that sound that sounds like the cutting edge of life?

So that nothing unseemly might spoil his feasting, he commanded the royal artisans to design the bull in such a way that its smoke rose in spicy clouds of incense. When the screams of the dying reached the tyrant’s ears, they had the sound of sweet music. And when the bull was reopened, the victims bones shone like jewels and were made into bracelets. Do you not sometimes wish that certain people might die, do you not long for the deaths of prime ministers or dictators, do you not envision presidents dying of heart attacks, generals shooting themselves while cleaning their rifles, skinflint landlords pushed into wells by rebellious peasants, industrialists skidding on newly waxed floors and sailing through penthouse windows, War Department scientists exposed to radiation while goosing cute researchers in the lab, demagogues exploding with the leaky gas main, your mother-in-law scalded by a pot of boiling chicken soup— do you not wish any or all of these were dead? If the death of one man could bring bliss to the world, would you order that one death? If the deaths of two men could do it, would you order those two deaths? Or five deaths? Or a hundred? Or twenty million? How many deaths would you order to bring bliss to the world? If it required only one man’s death, after all, to bring bliss to the world and you sanctioned such a death, how would you feel should you learn that that one man was to be you? Do you think that the most monstrous thing about the story of Phalaris is not that a tyrant put prisoners to death—since that has happened throughout history—but the particularly gruesome way he went about it? Yet do you never catch yourself wishing that once, only once, once only but definitely once, you could sit beside the tyrant just to satisfy your curiosity about what the bull looked like, what the music sounded like? Would you consider Phalaris and his artisans more, or less, reprehensible if the screams of the dying had reached the ear undisguised? If you were one of the victims, would it make any difference to you? Which do you consider the more truly good man, the victim who wishes his screams to be heard as screams, or he who wishes them to be heard as music? Do you think your answer is relevant to the problem of why at executions we praise the victim who meets his death with stoic calm and witty epigrams, rather than he who must be dragged to the scaffold pissing in his pants? In your opinion, is it or is it not a good thing that we do so? Learning at this point in the examination that the first victim of the bull was the chief artisan who designed it, do you a believe that the artisan deserved his fate?, and b feel vaguely uncomfortable about your own occupation, job, profession, or calling?

Still, from those fluid beginnings and slow revolutions, the cement itself forms the pale and stony squares of sidewalk. Reassuring. Roller skates, hopscotch, salted ice.

On his father’s death, he returned home to look after the dispensary, becoming the chemist of a small village on the outskirts of Viadana in the province of Mantua. Word of his learning had spread in the country areas, fed by rumours about his huge library, about his prodigious cure for ear-ache, his ultra-modern method for irrigating the fields, and his fluency in twelve languages, not to mention rumours that he was translating the Divine Comedy into German. The owner of a cheese-making factory in the area decided to pay a stipend to the scholar, who was by now middle-aged, in return for which he would help his daughter with her grammar school education. The girl, a sporting type, was not doing too well at school and, furthermore, she hated books, Latin, and good Italian prose. The chemist accepted—more from love of learning than for any financial motive—and every day for a whole summer he went to give lessons to the young athlete. And one day it happened that the young athlete fell in love with him—so much so that she dropped all sport in favour of writing poetry, Latin verse and, of course, long letters. There are still people who talk of the car the chemist bought to mark the occasion, the couple’s long country trips, and even of nocturnal liaisons in a barn. At any rate, evidence of their late-summer affair only came to light the following winter when a bundle of letters was confiscated by the nuns at the girl’s convent school, and duly handed over to her parents. The contents of these letters seemed so disgusting in the eyes of the owner of the cheese-making factory that he decided to ruin the chemist, and drive him from the village forever. The girl’s brothers, who were active fascists at the time, ransacked his shop on the village square a number of times, and on one occasion gave its owner a savage beating. However, all this does not seem to have unduly worried the chemist. For a while, he continued to receive customers in the ransacked pharmacy, surrounded by broken window panes, torn down shelves and smashed jars. Then, one fine day, he shut up shop and withdrew among his books, rarely venturing out. All the village knew him to be deep in his studies, and every now and again they saw him smiling as he crossed the square and headed for the post office to pick up new books that had arrived for him. Some time later, he was taken to hospital and then to a sanatorium. He remained for a number of years in the sanatorium, and no one heard any more about him. On his return from the sanatorium, the ageing scholar was extremely thin. An old housemaid, who had gone back to taking care of him, complained to everyone that he never wanted to eat, he said he didn’t care to eat, and spent the whole day immersed in his books. Thinner by the day, the man seldom went out and evidently no longer recognized anyone in the village, including the daughter of the now deceased owner of the cheese-making factory who he occasionally met in the square. Yet he smiled at all and sundry, and it is said he used to greet dogs by raising his hat. Apparently, he had given up eating altogether after his old housemaid died and persisted in fasting for weeks on end, so that when he was found dead in his library by a plumber he was a skeleton in all but name: all that remained of him was wrinkled skin clinging to bones. He was bent over the last page of a book onto which he was sticking a strip of paper. Years later, his large library was inherited by a niece. The niece, rummaging through the books, believed she had worked out how the old scholar had spent the last part of his life. For this man, every story, novel, or epic poem had to end happily. He obviously couldn’t bear tragic endings, nor for a story to end on a sad or melancholic note. So, over the years, he devoted himself to re-writing the endings of some hundred or so books in every conceivable language. By inserting small sheets or strips of paper over passages that had to be re-written, he utterly changed the outcome of the stories, bringing them unfailingly to a happy ending. Many of the last days of his life must have been dedicated to re-writing the eighth chapter of the third part of Madame Bovary, which is where Emma dies. In the new version, Emma recovers and is reunited with her husband. His very last piece of work, however, consisted of the strip of paper he had in his fingers and which, on the point of dying of starvation, he was sticking onto the last line of a French translation of a Russian novel. This was possibly his masterpiece; by changing just three words, he transformed a tragedy into a satisfactory resolution of life’s problems.","id":426},{"author":"MOACYR SCLIAR","author_meta":"(Brazil, 1937–2011)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Agenda of Executive Jorge T.

A bath, soon afterward. Breakfast: orange juice, toast, eggs. Eat with appetite, chew vigorously and swiftly; don’t ruminate, don’t mix food with bitter thoughts. Don’t. Coffee. Very strong, with sugar today, just today, never again from now on, avoid expressions such as never again. Finish off the meal with a glass of ice-cold water, sipping it slowly. Pay special attention to the ice cubes tinkling against the glass. Joyful sound. Wake up the wife. Make love. And why not? She’s been the companion of so many years. Wife, mother. Make love, yes, a quick act of love, but with the utmost tenderness. Let her go back to sleep afterward. Let her roam through the country of dreams as much as she wants; let her say farewell to her monsters, to her demons, to her fairies, to her princesses, to her godparents. Gymnastics. Brisk, fierce movements. Afterward, feel the arms tingling, the head throbbing, splitting, almost: life. Take the car out of the garage. Drive downtown. Take advantage of the time spent driving to do some thinking. Try to clarify certain doubts once and for all; maybe stop off at the rabbi’s place. Maybe talk to a priest as well. Maybe bring priest and rabbi together? At the office. Render decisions on the latest documents. Tidy up the desk. Clean out the drawers, throw away gewgaws. Set pen to paper. Write a letter, a poem, anything. Write. Luncheon. Friends. Salad, cold cuts. Wine. Gab away, talk drivel. Laugh. Observe the faces. Memorize the details of the faces. Hug the friends. Hug them deeply touched. But tearless. No tears at all. Phone Dr. Francisco. Ask if there’s anything that can be done quite unlikely; but say no to tranquilizers. Return home. Get the family together, including the baby of the family. Mention they’ll be taken for a drive, and get the station wagon out of the garage. Head for the outskirts of the city. Find a spot on an elevation with a panoramic view. Park. Have everybody get out of the car. In a low, quiet voice, explain what is about to happen: the earth, which will open up explain: as if it were parched, the bones, which will appear—the bones only, white, clean—bones that will then be covered with flesh, with hair, with eyes, with finger and toenails: men, women, laughing, crying.","id":427},{"author":"CHARLES SIMIC","author_meta":"(Serbia/United States, 1938–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"NO-TITLE","text":"Everybody knows the story about me and Dr. Freud, says my grandfather. We were in love with the same pair of black shoes in the window of the same shoe store. The store, unfortunately, was always closed. There’d be a sign, DEATH IN THE FAMILY or BACK AFTER LUNCH, but no matter how long I waited, no one would come to open. Once I caught Dr. Freud there shamelessly admiring the shoes. We glared at each other before going our separate ways, never to meet again. It was the epoch of the masters of levitation. Some evenings we saw solitary men and women floating above the dark tree tops. Could they have been sleeping or thinking? They made no attempt to navigate. The wind nudged them ever so slightly. We were afraid to speak, to breathe. Even the nightbirds were quiet. Later, we’d mention the little book clasped in the hands of the young woman, and the way that old man lost his hat to the cypresses. In the morning there were not even clouds in the sky. We saw a few crows preen themselves at the edge of the road; the shirts raise their empty sleeves on the blind woman’s clothesline. My guardian angel is afraid of the dark. He pretends he’s not, sends me ahead, tells me he’ll be along in a moment. Pretty soon I can’t see a thing. This must be the darkest corner of heaven, someone whispers behind my back. It turns out her guardian angel is missing too. It’s an outrage, I tell her. The dirty little cowards leaving us all alone, she whispers. And of course, for all we know, I might be a hundred years old already, and she just a sleepy little girl with glasses. I knew a woman who collected black buttons she found in the street. Some years there’d be only one or two. When I asked her what for and why only black buttons, she shrugged her shoulders. She kept them in a jar on the coffee table. They seduced the eye. One button even had some thread left as if it had been torn in a hurry. A violent scene took place, a burst of passion on some dark doorway, and then she came along the next day and found the button. A narrow street with windows weakly lit at dinner time and self-absorbed men and women standing around and an occasional child who eats alone looking at nothing. My aspiration is to create a kind of nongenre made up of fiction, autobiography, the essay, poetry, and of course, the joke. A scene from French movies of the fifties that I still love: A fly gets shut in a room with three armed thugs and a woman, gagged and bound, who watches them with eyes popping. In front of each man on the table there is a sugar cube and a pile of large bills. No one stirs. A naked bulb hangs from the ceiling by a long wire so they can see the fly count its legs. It counts them on the table, tantalizingly close to a sugar cube, and then it counts them at the end of someone’s nose. I have no idea if this is the way it really was in the movie. I’ve worked on the scene over the years, making little adjustments in it as one does with a poem. Descartes, I hear, did his best philosophizing by lazing in bed past noon. Not me! I’m on the way to the dump, tooting my horn and waving to the neighbors.","id":428},{"author":"LUISA VALENZUELA","author_meta":"(Argentina, 1938–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Best Shod","text":"An invasion of beggars, but there’s one consolation, no one lacks shoes, there are more than enough shoes to go around. Sometimes, it’s true, a shoe has to be taken off some severed leg found in the underbrush, and it’s of no use except to somebody with only one good leg. But this doesn’t happen very often, usually corpses are found with both shoes intact. Their clothing on the other hand isn’t usable. Ordinarily it has bullet holes, bloodstains, or is torn apart, or an electric cattle prod has left burns that are ugly and difficult to hide. So we don’t count on the clothes, but the shoes are like new. Generally they’re good, they haven’t had much wear because their owners haven’t been allowed to get very far in life. They poke out their heads, they start thinking thinking doesn’t wear out shoes, and after just a few steps their career is cut off. That is to say, we find shoes, and since they’re not always the size we need, we’ve set up a little exchange post in a vacant lot downtown. We charge only a few pesos for the service: you can’t ask much from a beggar, but even so it does help to pay for maté and some biscuits. We earn real money only when we manage to have a real sale. Sometimes the families of the dead people, who’ve heard of us heaven knows how, ask us to sell them the dead man’s shoes if we have them. The shoes are the only thing that they can bury, poor things, because naturally the authorities would never let them have the body. It’s too bad that a good pair of shoes drops out of circulation, but we have to live and we can’t refuse to work for a good cause. Ours is a true apostolate and that’s what the police think, too, so they never bother us as we search about in vacant lots, sewer conduits, fallow fields, thickets, and other nooks and crannies where a corpse may be hidden. The police are well aware that, thanks to us, this city can boast of being the one with the bestshod beggars in the world.","id":429},{"author":"MARGARET ATWOOD","author_meta":"(Canada, 1939–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Instructions for the Third Eye","text":"The eye is the organ of vision, and the third eye is no exception to that. Open it and it sees, close it and it doesn’t. Most people have a third eye but they don’t trust it. That wasn’t really F., standing on the corner, hands in his overcoat pockets, waiting for the light to change, F. died two months ago. It’s a trick my eyes played on me, they say. A trick of the light. I’ve got nothing against telepathy, said Jane; but the telephone is so much more dependable. What’s the difference between vision and a vision? The former relates to something it’s assumed you’ve seen, the latter to something it’s assumed you haven’t. Language is not always dependable either. If you want to use the third eye you must close the other two. Then breathe evenly; then wait. This sometimes works; on the other hand, sometimes you merely go to sleep. That sometimes works also. When you’ve had enough practice you don’t have to bother with these preliminary steps. You find too that what you see depends partly on what you want to look at and partly on how. As I said, the third eye is only an eye. There are some who resent the third eye. They would have it removed, if they could. They feel it as a parasite, squatting in the centre of the forehead, feeding on the brain. To them the third eye shows only the worst scenery: the gassed and scorched corpses at the cave-mouth, the gutted babies, the spoor left by generals, and, closer to home, the hearts gone bubonic with jealousy and greed, glinting through the vests and sweaters of anyone at all. Torment, they say and see. The third eye can be merciless, especially when wounded. But someone has to see these things. They exist. Try not to resist the third eye: it knows what it’s doing. Leave it alone and it will show you that this truth is not the only truth. One day you will wake up and everything, the stones by the driveway, the brick houses, each brick, each leaf of each tree, your own body, will be glowing from within, lit up, so bright you can hardly look. You will reach out in any direction and you will touch the light itself. After that there are no more instructions because there is no more choice. You see.

Look, there is a hillside cemetery behind us and across the river the plough going in a field and in between, the gated town. Here, an obedient clerk kissing a bishop’s ring, here a frieze of seasonal games, and here the assiduous illuminator himself, bowed to his desk in a corner. In the study hall my hand was cold as a scribe’s in winter. The supervisor rustled past, sibilant, vapouring into his breviary, his welted brogues unexpectedly secular under the soutane.

We had goats, ducks and geese that chased after me, and a vegetable garden. I remember my father gathering giant tomatoes from his garden and juicing them into a large porcelain bowl on the square dining room table. I still remember the glassfuls tasting dank and dark. To this day I still cannot stand its rawness, but drink it camouflaged in a Bloody Mary. Since I’ve moved to Idaho and live in my own house, I’ve been raising vegetable gardens in the backyard every season. Among the corn, squash, eggplant, spinach and beet I’ve always saved room for a few tomato plants, even though I never eat them but give them away to friends at harvest time. In the middle of the summer I sometimes walk out of the house and listen to these plants grow, often flicking tiny black aphids from off their stems and leaves. In these moments the tangy odor of their leaves draw childhood recollections of a father dead nineteen years, images of his hands immersed in the white porcelain bowl of tomato juice from his garden, him saying Drink it, drink it, it’s only good for you, it’s vitamin C. Tonight, at exactly my father’s age in 1944 and nearly five thousand miles and fifty years from my past, I wake to hear the tomato leaves brushing gently against the backdoor of my house in the breeze, and soon after, the fruit bursting like blood in the burgeoning quarter moon.","id":432},{"author":"ROBERT HASS","author_meta":"(United States, 1941–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Novella","text":"A woman who, as a thirteen-year-old girl, develops a friendship with a blind painter, a painter who is going blind. She is Catholic, lives in the country. He rents a cabin from her father, and she walks through the woods—redwood, sword fern, sorrel—to visit him. He speaks to her as an equal and shows her his work. He has begun to sculpt but still paints, relying on color and the memory of line. He also keeps English biscuits in a tin and gives her one each visit. She would like more but he never gives her more. When he undresses her, she sometimes watches him, watches his hands which are thick and square, or his left eye with a small cloud like gray phlegm on the retina. But usually not. Usually she thinks of the path to his house, whether deer had eaten the tops of the fiddleheads, why they don’t eat the peppermint saprophytes sprouting along the creek; or she visualizes the approach to the cabin, its large windows, the fuchsias in front of it where Anna’s hummingbirds always hover with dirty green plumage and jeweled throats. Sometimes she thinks about her dream, the one in which her mother wakes up with no hands. The cabin smells of oil paint, but also of pine. The painter’s touch is sexual and not sexual, as she herself is. From time to time she remembers this interval in the fall and winter of ninth grade. By spring the painter had moved. By summer her period had started. And after that her memory blurred, speeding up. One of her girlfriends French-kissed a boy on a Friday night in the third row from the back at the Tamalpais theater. The other betrayed her and the universe by beginning to hang out with the popular girls whose fathers bought them cars. When the memory of that time came to her, it was touched by strangeness because it formed no pattern with the other events in her life. It lay in her memory like one piece of broken tile, salmon-colored or the deep green of wet leaves, beautiful in itself but unusable in the design she was making. Just the other day she remembered it. Her friends were coming up from the beach with a bucket full of something, smiling and waving to her, shouting something funny she couldn’t make out, and suddenly she was there—the light flooding through the big windows, the litter of canvases, a white half-finished torso on the worktable, the sweet, wheaty odor of biscuits rising from the just-opened tin.","id":433},{"author":"LYN HEJINIAN","author_meta":"(United States, 1941–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"NO-TITLE","text":"Once there was a girl and she went for a walk by herself and came upon a hole in the ground no bigger than her finger.

One right by the church, frequented by the bagaço-swigging proletariat, the floor was always strewn with sawdust and flattened cigarette butts, and that was called the Adega dos Ossos, where I was advised not to go for fear I might become fatally addicted to cherry brandy and cheap cigarettes and end my days playing dominoes, losing at cards and coughing into my handkerchief. It was a dark place, with lots of bottles on the walls, and in the window were more flies than custard tarts. Beyond the shelves and the spines of the bottles, a library of delirium tremens, I remember the squint-eyed bartender, his right eye furious and his left benevolently tender, and Senhor Manuel, the sacristan, who dropped by in his red surplice between masses and downed a few glasses with eucharistic unctuousness, hiding behind the fridge, afraid he might be spotted by the prior, who was all sternness and buttons from his neck to his shoes, and for whom wine, when not taken with wafers, had the devilish quality of leading the flock astray and causing them to postpone the six o’clock rosary in favor of the abominable vice of cards. The other bakery, the Benfica Paradise, almost opposite the first, was frequented after mass by ladies whose devotion was rustproof, antimagnetic and bulletproof—for example, my grandmothers and my aunts whose intimate knowledge of the saints amazed me and who hastened to teach me the catechism after I asked, pointing my finger at the Holy Spirit What’s that sparrow doing there? explaining to me that God was not a sparrow, he was a dove, and I immediately imagined him in Praça de Camões eating out of the hands of pensioners, which hardly seemed to me an activity compatible with the creation of the universe. Paradise was filled by ladies after mass and by men during it. When a cousin of mine indignantly asked her husband why he wasn’t going to church, he replied with a small smug smile I don’t need to, I’m in Paradise already. It’s cooler and they serve beer. Unlike the Adega dos Ossos it smelled good, none of the employees had a squint, and dominoes was banned. Senhor Manuel’s surplice did not flutter furtively behind the fridge and, most important of all, my brothers and I had an open account there for cake and ice cream. At first I was so touched by the generosity of that open account I almost wept with gratitude. I realize later that it was not really an act of generosity: it was because on Sundays we had lunch at my grandmother’s house and the gift of ice cream and doughnuts was intended to distract me from the firm posterior of the cook whose charms I had recently discovered. Torn between two equally celestial Paradises, I hesitated for months on end between coconut fancies and the four rings of the stove. I finally opted for the stove. When, sometime later, the cook married a policeman all the cooks married policemen and I tried to go back to the doughnuts, my grandmother, disillusioned with my sinful ways, had canceled the account. In desperation, I accompanied her on an excursion for widows to Fátima in an attempt to win back both her affection and the cakes: not even this heroic sacrifice moved her. And I went on to live in a painful state of double orphanhood from which no cheese pastry and no apron has yet shown any interest in rescuing me.","id":436},{"author":"RON PADGETT","author_meta":"(United States, 1942–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Salt and Pepper Shakers","text":"My wife and I have been meaning to buy a set of salt and pepper shakers for the past several years.

And the bears knew Fydor: his tics, his tenacity, and his peculiar smell—rancid as old fat forgotten at the bottom of a can. Still, Fydor was the more cunning. By the roots of windblown trees he dug deep traps and made them secret beneath weavings of bracken and leaves. Many times in the passing of the year would a bear sink with a nauseating thud to be stung by Fydor’s arrows, enfevered with sleep, and hauled off to one of the many stout cages he kept in a cellar called home. Fydor hated his bears yet could not live without them. Their intimate habits, their torments and hungers excited him, sickened him, obsessed him. He thrived in the stench of their fur, their urine, and their tears. And in time the bears became obsessed with Fydor. Locked into their cages like flies in amber, they turned to him—for he was the only thing they could turn to. They watched him, memorized his habits: the way he shuffled across the littered floors, or held a pan of water beneath a tap. In time the bears knew Fydor better than a woman knows her man after sharing a half century of boredom and bed. And as alchemists fool with foul matter changing colors and structures, the bears—woolly and immense—entered into Fydor’s dreams, and changed Fydor. Night after night they lumbered down the narrow passages of Fydor’s mind to browse its rag stalls, its cut-rate china shops, leaving droppings, making drafts, causing sunset changes. They brought burdens of flowers, of fire; as at a shrine, they drugged the air. And vines grew inside Fydor’s mind, and halls of green shadow; lean hills, red earth, and places of perpetual picnic. Fydor’s skull—barren before—sprouted grass. His dim, fly-ridden eyes grew luminous. Bears were now coursing through his blood, inhabiting his heart, his liver, his testicles. His nerves writhed bears. His skin crawled bears. His bowels groaned: Bears. His cock yearned: Bears! He ate, slept, dreamed, fucked, and defecated bears until waking in a frenzy of longing, his eyes wild and circling the room like bears on bicycles, he ran to them, his pants bulging with longing and with keys. Fingers trembling, he found the locks and set them free to lumber off into the night. And Fydor followed them.

His overcoat was a fine camel’s hair, such as I had seen only in the movies. He had on a soft beige scarf and brown woolen gloves and a brown fedora. I’m so sorry, it was my fault completely. Are you all right? I nodded, laughing now at the comic spill I had taken, like a cartoon character. How could I explain to him that it had been a pleasure to fly through the air, that there was something even comforting about a collision with such a manly, yet considerate, adult as this stranger. I pulled my sticky palms off the sidewalk. The skin was torn up, and bleeding. Here, I think I’ve got a Kleenex, he said. He reached into his pocket, felt around, and came up with a monogrammed handkerchief. I stared at the sharp crease in his pants as he crouched alongside me, brushing off the dirt; I was so in love with him that I felt too embarrassed to look at his face. Does that hurt much? No, it doesn’t hurt at all, I lied. I just didn’t see you. I was in too big of a hurry, I guess. I was also in a hurry. This corner is very tricky. People always seem to have accidents here. I wondered how he knew that. As though he could read my mind, he went on to explain, I have a law office nearby, and I see these accident cases all the time. Suddenly the words Notary Public popped into my mind. I had read them on golden decals in store windows and wondered often what they meant. Are you a Notary Public? I asked. No, just a lawyer, he laughed gently. My name’s Tony, Tony Bauer it sounded like. My office is right across Roebling Street, on the second floor. Why don’t you come visit me sometime? Do you think you’ll be able to walk now? Maybe we should take you to a drugstore first and get them to put some iodine on your hand. I’m all right, I said, letting him help me up. He handed me my blue-and-red bookbag. Only now did I realize I felt dizzy from the blow. Everything was whirling with black outlines in the winter snow. I was going to have another of my headaches. Well—goodbye for now. It was a pleasure meeting you, he said, and I felt he really meant it. Too bad it had to come about this way. Then the stranger took off one glove, and was careful not to hurt my bruise in his handshake. I had never seen an adult show a child such tact.

He had never encountered a parasite he didn’t, in some way, envy for a kind of perverse talent. The tidal forces of the Moon—and the Sun—don’t act only on the oceans, they act on the land too. Stand on the equator, and the land beneath you will rise and fall as much as twenty-one inches over the course of twenty-four hours. Vertigo restrained her from standing near expansive plate-glass windows on the upper floors of top-heavy skyscrapers. She teetered on high heels, the foundation undulating beneath her feet, or maybe she was moonstruck again. The Moon is about the same age as Earth. When the Moon was created, it was much closer to Earth and appeared ten times larger in the sky. In Sunday school, he asked his teacher, Why did God make the Moon without people? His father told him the moon was too cold for people, it was the dark side of God’s work; then his mother broke in, Your father’s being funny. Look at the TV. Michael Jackson, honey, he’s moon-walking. The Moon is full when the Earth is between the Sun and Moon, it is a New Moon when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth. Nocturnal creatures, cats nightly play and prance, hunting mice, hearing their faint movements behind plaster walls, while their owners beseech moon gods for love and power. The Moon is not a planet, but a satellite of the Earth. Being an identical twin was way cooler than being a virtual one—adopted at the same time, same age, but studies showed virtuals were very different people. He and his brother were unique, even if they looked the same, and he didn’t moon about his lost individuality, the way his twin did. An afterglow—also called post-luminescence—is a wide arc of glowing light that can sometimes be seen high in the western sky at twilight; it is caused by fine particles of dust scattering light in the upper atmosphere. She loved the line, When a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets. She scratched his right arm and nudged him. Naked, you don’t have pockets, he said, unless you’re a fucking kangaroo. Moonlight did nothing for this guy. Alan Shepard, when he was on the Moon, hit a golf ball and drove it 2400 feet, nearly half a mile. The moon is made of green cheese, and that crater on it, it’s really a man in the moon. And I haven’t drunk any moonshine. At the full Moon, the times of moonrise and moonset have advanced so that the Moon rises about the same time the Sun sets, and the Moon sets about the same time the sun rises. Their honeymoon, after years of living together, still scared up traditional illusions, intimations of ecstasy, a time out from reality, and when the second night of connubial bliss yawned on, she quoted George Meredith, Where may these lunatics have gone to spend the Moon. Ramadan begins with the sighting of the new crescent Moon in the ninth month of the lunar calendar. But whose sighting counts? She read the first sentence of the book: A white dog bayed at the Moon, a true moon-dog, with moon-blindness, more blind sometimes than others. The writer must be a lunatic. Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, a geological surveyor who educated the Apollo mission astronauts about craters, never made it to the Moon . . .. He was rejected as an astronaut because of medical problems. After he died, his ashes were placed on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft on January 6, 1999 . . . and fulfilled Dr. Shoemaker’s last wish. Once in a blue moon, the tides pull at us. They invoke humans to recall primitive ancestors who shouted at the sky, noisemakers who yowled in the dark, beckoning forces and spirits to aid their survival. Now, domesticated dogs guard their masters lives, and house cats daydream about orangutans swinging happily from branch to branch. Human beings cannot stop being afraid of the dark or imagining complete freedom.","id":443},{"author":"PAUL VIOLI","author_meta":"(United States, 1944–2011)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Snorkeling with Captain Bravo","text":"A belief in the perfectability of man boodle loop bloodle loop bloop bloop bloop can only lead to despair and needlessly heavy breathing bloodle loo loo bloop bloop bloop try not to laugh bloodoop just keep those flippers working close to the surface sputter sputter between worlds goolp goolp the fatal yawn of totalitarian bloodle loop boodle loop the violent die stupid deaths bloop bloop avoid cults goolp no theory no bloop system no book will save you doodle oop doop doop be a true seeker and fall forever upward like an angel bloop bloop bloop","id":444},{"author":"SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS","author_meta":"(United States, 1945–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Aurora Means Dawn","text":"When Mr. and Mrs. Job Sheldon reached Ohio in 1800, with seven children, two oxen, and a bulging wagon, they were greeted by a bone-rattling thunderstorm. The children wailed. Mrs. Sheldon spoke of returning to Connecticut. The oxen pretended to be stone outcroppings, and would budge neither forward nor backward for all of Mr. Sheldon’s thwacking. Lightning toppled so many oaks and elms across the wagon track, in any case, that even a dozen agreeable oxen would have done them no good. They camped. More precisely, they spent the night squatting in mud beneath the wagon, trying to keep dry. Mrs. Sheldon kept saying there had never been any storms even remotely like this one back in Connecticut. Nor any cheap land, her husband added. No land’s cheap if you perish before setting eyes on it, she said. And that ended talk for the night. Every few minutes, Mrs. Sheldon would count the children, touching each head in turn, to make sure none of the seven had vanished in the deluge. Next morning it was hard to tell just where the wagon track had been, there were so many trees down. Husband and wife tried cutting their way forward. After chopping up and dragging aside only a few felled trees, and with half the morning gone, they decided Mr. Sheldon should go fetch help from Aurora, their destination. On the land-company map they had carried from the East, Aurora was advertised as a village, with mill and store and clustered cabins. But the actual place turned out to consist of a surveyor’s post, topped by a red streamer. So Mr. Sheldon walked to the next village shown on the map— Hudson—which fortunately did exist, and there he found eight men who agreed to help him clear the road. Their axes flashed for hours in the sunlight before they reached the wagon. The children huddled in shirts while their outer garments dried on nearby bushes. Mrs. Sheldon sat fully dressed and shivering. With the track cleared, the oxen still could not move the wagon through the mud until all nine men and one woman and every child except the toddler and the baby put their shoulders to the wheels. Even though they reached Aurora after nightfall, making out the surveyor’s post in lantern light, the eight ax men insisted on returning immediately to their own homes. The blades glinted on their shoulders as they disappeared from the circle of the campfire. Dry at last, Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon carried the lantern through this forest that would become their farm. Aurora meant dawn; they knew that. And their family was the dawn of dawn, the first glimmering in this new place. The next settlers did not come for three years.","id":445},{"author":"DIANE WILLIAMS","author_meta":"(United States, 1946–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Glass of Fashion","text":"My mother touched the doctor’s hair—Your hair— she said. I was looking at the doctor’s eyes—black and as sad as any eyes I had ever looked at—doleful, mournful—but I thought she is hard-hearted too, this doctor. She must be hard-hearted. Hard-Hearted is part of her job. It has to be. The doctor’s hair was full and long and kinky and wavy and black. My mother’s hair is short and white and kinky and wavy and I could see why my mother was admiring the doctor’s hair. I was admiring the doctor’s body in her jeans. She had what I thought was a girlish and perfect form in her jeans, an enviable form. There were four of us backed up to the large window at the end of the hall, because I had said, Let’s go over to the window to talk—my mother, my sister, and me, and this very young woman doctor with black hair, black eyes, and jeans on. We were at the window at the hospital, at the end of a hall, down from what was left of my father. We were getting the report on my father, because I had said to the doctor, Tell us. Maybe the doctor was a little ashamed too, or belligerent, when she was telling us. Her eyes had such a film over them, so that they sparkled when she spoke of his cerebellum, about his brain stem, about the size of his cortical function. She said, He doesn’t know who he is. He does not know who he once was. He does not feel grief or frustration. He does not know who you are. What I was envying then were the doctor’s legs in her jeans. Maybe— I said, you know, maybe—he had such a big brain before—it is just possible, I said, that even if his brain has been ravaged, he is still a smart enough person. The doctor did not say anything about that. No one did. Chrissy, one of Dad’s day-shift nurses, was coming along then toward us. Her glasses are the kind my sister will not wear. She will not get glasses like that. My mother will not either. A serious person’s glasses—even if Chrissy is only just a nurse, even if she cannot explain very much about the brain, because she explained to me she has been out of school for too long— I can tell she is serious, that she is serious about me too. If she were a man, I would call what we have shared romantic love—we have shared so much, so often here—talking about my father with feeling. If she were a man—even if she couldn’t remember half of what she had learned about the brain—even if she had forgotten it all—no—if she had forgotten it all, totally, I don’t think I’d want to spend the time of day in her presence. She would disgust me if she were a man like that. So when she called us, when she said, Your father— and then when I called Dad. Dad! from the—and it sounded even to me as if I expected he would rise up—then I was ready for what I was feeling when I touched his forehead—which was still warm. His mouth was open. The front of the lower row of his teeth was showing. The teeth had never looked, each of them, so terribly small. Some of his teeth were the last things on my father that I ever touched.","id":446},{"author":"RAE ARMANTROUT","author_meta":"(United States, 1947–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Imaginary Places","text":"Reading, we are allowed to follow someone else’s train of thought as it starts off for an imaginary place.

At first, with our wives gone, our spirits rose and we all thought the sound was beautiful. But then we ceased to be aware of it, grew uneasy, and quarreled more often among ourselves. That was during the year of high winds. Never before had such tumult raged in our village. Sparrows could not fly, but swerved and dropped into calm corners; clay tiles tumbled from the roofs and shattered on the pavement. Shrubbery whipped our low windows. Night after night we drank insanely and fell asleep in one another’s arms. When spring came, the winds died down and the sun was bright. At evening, long shadows fell across our floors, and only the glint of a knife blade could survive the darkness. And the darkness fell across our spirits, too. We no longer had a kind word for anyone. We went to our fields grudgingly. Silently we stared at the strangers who came to see our fountain and our church, we leaned against the lip of the fountain, our boots crossed, our maimed dogs shying away from us. Then the road fell into disrepair. No strangers came. Even the traveling priest no longer dared enter the village, though the sun blazed in the water of the fountain, the valley far below was white with flowering fruit and nut trees, and the heat seeped into the pink stones of the church at noon and ebbed out at dusk. Cats paced silently over the beaten dirt, from doorway to doorway. Birds sang in the woods behind us. We waited in vain for visitors, hunger gnawing at our stomachs. At last, somewhere deep in the heart of the cedar trees, our wives stirred and thought of us. And lazily, it seemed to us, carelessly, returned home. We looked on their mean lips, their hard eyes, and our hearts melted.

Baudelaire, I am no one but the insatiable identities that descend upon me and tonight it is you. I’ve thought, if Baudelaire were not Baudelaire, I would be Baudelaire, though in truth I have thought the same about Walter Benjamin when he says I paraphrase, I am in love with Baudelaire because of his interest in furniture. When writing about furniture Baudelaire is free from capitalism’s philosophy and history and archaeology and is enthralled by upholstery, and this is a way of thinking and being that is wholly new in the world and was made so by Baudelaire. No quotation is innocent. Every quotation is an act of ventriloquism. Every ventriloquism is an usurpation. As R. P. Blackmur said and here I do not quote but paraphrase, If you say there is no blackbird in a poem immediately a blackbird alights on the branch of a line. If you say, I am only quoting, immediately your voice guiltily alights on the branches of the words. In Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism, as Walter Benjamin carries forward the great cross of his love for you, as he is nailing himself to his love for you, at the height of his passion, he stops on page seventy-one to quote that gnat Maxime Du Camp: Baudelaire had what is a great defect in a writer, a defect of which he was not aware: he was ignorant. . .. He remained unacquainted with history, physiology, archeology and philosophy. . .. He had little interest in the outside world; he may have been aware of it, but he certainly did not study it. And in doing so, at the height of his love, Walter Benjamin enters and is entered, he becomes Maxime Du Camp. Baudelaire knew nothing, says sneers Benjamin. Why, I have always wondered, does he do that? Cher Baudelaire, I believe that behind or inside Benjamin’s quotation from Maxime Du Camp, growing upon it as a vine grows on a trellis, there lives the envy and sorrow of a man cut off from the possibility of another’s experience. There lives the envy of a man who knew history for another man who did not; there lives the love of a man Benjamin who loved philosophy for a man you who did not love it and by extension would not have loved him Benjamin or perhaps could not love him. Would you have wasted an afternoon on Benjamin? No. Is there even one syllable in you to suggest that you care at all about Benjamin? No. Which must have hurt. I, on the other hand, am perfectly aware that you adore me because we adore so many of the same things—furniture, women’s dresses, recreational drugs. In every line and flourish I hear you calling out to me as I sit here in the furnishings of the future; I see you waving to me in the windows of my train of thought as though you were waving to yourself at some time in the future; as though I were you with my poems filled with dresses and drugs and unfaithful women, some of whom are me. How grateful you are that I have resurrected you, that you can live in the present with all its wonderful appurtenances, with its fantastic advances in perfumes, the advent of hair gel, the Alps of the four-inch stiletto. How lucky you are, cher Baudelaire, to have found me to shelter you, to have found the succulent hallways of my lines, and the shimmering windows of my tropes, and the sticky navels of the little hash pipes I have left lying about for you, the ease, the comfort, the respite my verse provides you. Or maybe not. I sit on my train and watch capitalism struggle in the windows. In the city of the mind the great alcove of night closes over us. Even over you, Baudelaire, who invented a world that had never before existed—a completely interior world of upholstery without philosophy— and in so doing gained the undying envy of the future Walter Benjamin, who was sentenced to live inside a world outside and who, therefore, had to save himself from that world and its history by committing suicide at Hotel de Francia in Port-Bou in September of 1940.","id":454},{"author":"JAMAICA KINCAID","author_meta":"(Antigua/United States, 1949–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Letter from Home","text":"I milked the cows, I churned the butter, I stored the cheese, I baked the bread, I brewed the tea, I washed the clothes, I dressed the children; the cat meowed, the dog barked, the horse neighed, the mouse squeaked, the fly buzzed, the goldfish living in a bowl stretched its jaws; the door banged shut, the stairs creaked, the fridge hummed, the curtains billowed up, the pot boiled, the gas hissed through the stove, the tree branches heavy with snow crashed against the roof; my heart beat loudly thud. thud!, tiny beads of water gathered on my nose, my hair went limp, my waist grew folds, I shed my skin; lips have trembled, tears have flowed, cheeks have puffed, stomachs have twisted with pain; I went to the country, the car broke down, I walked back; the boat sailed, the waves broke, the horizon tipped, the jetty grew small, the air stung, some heads bobbed, some handkerchiefs fluttered; the drawers didn’t close, the faucets dripped, the paint peeled, the walls cracked, the books tilted over, the rug no longer lay out flat; I ate my food, I chewed each mouthful thirty-two times, I swallowed carefully, my toe healed; there was a night, it was dark, there was a moon, it was full, there was a bed, it held sleep; there was movement, it was quick, there was a being, it stood still, there was a space, it was full, then there was nothing; a man came to the door and asked, Are the children ready yet?

On March 11, 1854, Eugene Delacroix sat down at his favorite desk a gift—actually one of many he had received from a Pasha in Tangiers and wrote in his journal: A long interruption in these poor notes of daily happenings: I feel very badly about it; these trifling pages written down in such a fugitive way seem to me all that is left of my life, the more it flows away. My lack of memory makes them necessary for me; since the beginning of the year, the steady work needed for finishing at the Hôtel de Ville has been distracting me too much; since I finished it, and that will soon be a month since, my eyes are in a bad state, I am afraid to read and to write. He felt as he put down the pen and straightened his back that the rest of his evenings, his nights and days, would be filled with a new kind of darkness. At first he thought he could turn to his friends. But Mme Sand was on her way to Vienna, and Chopin had not received him twice in the last week. Most likely, he was in the throes of composition. Delacroix felt his fears being heightened by the underlying silence of day becoming night. He wished he were sitting in the green brocade chair in Frederic’s apartment, listening to him playing the piano. The evening’s shadows, both inside and outside, were beginning to overlap, while he remained seated at his desk, his chin cupped between his hands, his eyes closed. He remembered that twenty years ago M. Gros had told him that he had once lived a life devoted to excess. But now he, M. Gros, drank nothing but water with dinner. In fact, being deprived of a cigar after dinner was the greatest hardship of all the ones he had to face. Delacroix wondered what he had forgotten about that evening. What moments would never be retrieved? It was well past midnight, yet restlessness permeated his movements. The moon slit the thick velvet drapes, but it couldn’t reach him. Instead, on either side of his bed two strips of light wavered along the carpet. Outside, someone remarked on the sultry beauty of the night in a high silly voice. I am afraid to read and to write. The lamp continued flickering; three dull concentric circles peered back from the ceiling. Delacroix rolled over on his side; he faced the night table, as he had done many times in the last few hours. Except for the table, everything had become a shadow; the chair in the corner was a blotch of darkness. He turned back to the table. A pile of books lay there, precariously balanced. They were a staircase rising in memory of the house that no longer surrounds them.","id":459},{"author":"MEENA ALEXANDER","author_meta":"(India/United States, 1951–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Crossing the Indian Ocean","text":"I was with my mother on the S.S. Jehangir, crossing the Indian Ocean. Midway on the journey I turned five. Bombay was far behind and Port Sudan still to come. It was my first sea voyage. Until then I had lived on solid land, on the Indian subcontinent and all my journeys had been by train or car or on small wooden boats on the canals and waterways of the coastal region I come from. The sea cast me loose. The sea tore away from me all that I had. In doing so, it gave me an interior life far sooner than I would have had otherwise, but at great cost. I was forced to enter another life, the life of the imagination. But it was not as yet the life of language. I had few words at my disposal, and those I had came from several languages that cohabited within my head. What I felt as a child and held deep within myself quite exceeded the store of words within my reach. This is something that I feel, even now as an adult. The struggle for words, the struggle to be human, is coexistent for me with the craft of poetry. On my fifth birthday I was plunged into a world with no before and no after. A child can fall into the sea, never to reappear. A mother can appear out of the waves, only to vanish, reappear, and then vanish again. The sea has no custom, no ceremony. It allows a theater for poetry, for a voice that cries out, that splits into one, two, three or more, chanting the figurations of the soul, marking a migrant memory. The day I turned five, I stuck my head out through the porthole of our cabin and saw ceaseless water. On and on, until my eyes and neck hurt, I kept watch. When I pulled my head back in I knew the sea was painted on the inside of my eyelids, would never leave me. Sometimes the syllables of poetry well up, waves on the surface of the sea, and they burst as flying fish might, struck by light. Sometimes I feel this is how I began, a wordless poet, a child on the surface of wide water with all that she loved torn from her, cast into ceaseless suspension. The page on which I write is a live restless thing, soul-sister to the unselving sea.","id":460},{"author":"BERNARD COOPER","author_meta":"(United States, 1951–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Saturday Night","text":"Can Mother muster enough thrust to leave the earth in a sudden leap?

It was the coldest night of the year, every place shut down, but not us. Of course we noticed when she came in. We were Indian ruins. She was the end of beauty. No one knew her, the stranger whose tribe we recognized, her family related to deer, if that’s who she was, a people accustomed to hearing songs in pine trees, and making them hearts. The woman inside the woman who was to dance naked in the bar of misfits blew deer magic. Henry Jack, who could not survive a sober day, thought she was Buffalo Calf Woman come back, passed out, his head by the toilet. All night he dreamed a dream he could not say. The next day he borrowed money, went home, and sent back the money I lent. Now that’s a miracle. Some people see vision in a burned tortilla, some in the face of a woman. This is the bar of broken survivors, the club of shotgun, knife wound, of poison by culture. We who were taught not to stare drank our beer. The players gossiped down their cues. Someone put a quarter in the jukebox to relive despair. Richard’s wife dove to kill her. We had to hold her back, empty her pockets of knives and diaper pins, buy her two beers to keep her still, while Richard secretly bought the beauty a drink. How do I say it? In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses. I could say it in my own and the sacred mounds would come into focus, but I couldn’t take it in this dingy envelope. So I look at the stars in this strange city, frozen to the back of the sky, the only promises that ever make sense. My brother-in-law hung out with white people, went to law school with a perfect record, quit. Says you can keep your laws, your words. And practiced law on the street with his hands. He jimmied to the proverbial dream girl, the face of the moon, while the players racked a new game. He bragged to us, he told her magic words and that’s when she broke, became human. But we all heard his bar voice crack, What’s a girl like you doing in a place like this? That’s what I’d like to know, what are we all doing in a place like this? You would know she could hear only what she wanted to; don’t we all? Left the drink of betrayal Richard bought her, at the bar. What was she on? We all wanted some. Put a quarter in the juke. We all take risks stepping into thin air. Our ceremonies didn’t predict this. Or we expected more. I had to tell you this, for the baby inside the girl sealed up with a lick of hope and swimming into praise of nations. This is not a rooming house, but a dream of winter falls and the deer who portrayed the relatives of strangers. The way back is deer breath on icy windows. The next dance none of us predicted. She borrowed a chair for the stairway to heaven and stood on a table of names. And danced in the room of children without shoes. You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille. With four hungry children and a crop in the field. And then she took off her clothes. She shook loose memory, waltzed with the empty lover we’d all become. She was the myth slipped down through dreamtime. The promise of feast we all knew was coming. The deer who crossed through knots of a curse to find us. She was no slouch, and neither were we, watching. The music ended. And so does the story. I wasn’t there. But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left.","id":462},{"author":"AMY HEMPEL","author_meta":"(United States, 1951–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Orphan Lamb","text":"He carved the coat off the dead winter lamb, wiped her blood on his pants to keep a grip, circling first the hooves and cutting straight up each leg, then punching the skin loose from muscle and bone.

That was the signal to transport myself to the big top, imagining the ringmaster’s introduction, Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the United States and Canada, here she is, Trixie, the tiger woman. I never divulged my hobby to him. Colette of the talking poodles, Chloe, the human fly, and Rosa, the rubber lady, were foreign to him as relaxing with a good circus novel. After another exasperating weekend of key-hunting, I drifted into an uneasy sleep. I dreamed that my husband and I were an acrobatic team. He was tall and worldly in military blue and a red shirt, designed to reveal his biceps, bulging like two loaves of bread. I wore a silver tutu, accentuating my small waist and large breasts. Our act was complex, and far surpassed any that I’d seen on television or read about in histories of the Flying Capezios. Like a shooting star, I’d hurl myself from the trapeze to be caught by my husband, who held a solid gold key between his teeth. People below gasped at his dental fortitude. Although the act was perilous and required the concentration of a bibliographer transcribing into braille, we’d smile at one another like fifteen-year-olds over a coke. I woke up feeling transformed. The next Saturday my husband was startled to find me dressed before him for our weekly tour of curio shops, garbage dumps, and demolished buildings.

El bandido wore the typical large sombrero, bandoliers loaded with bullets, and a huge handlebar moustache. He rode into battle on horses with his men, his victories accumulating as the masses revolted throughout the country. When he held court around huge campfires, his men huddled close and listened to every word. When his enemies were lined up against adobe walls to be shot, his men relished the opportunity to be in one of the firing squads. El bandido had a large belly and a round face, prominent features in hundreds of antique photographs of the war. His cruelty against his enemies and his love of women were legendary. His horse was a prize stallion and his soldiers were always well armed. El bandido’s hacienda was heavily guarded and the dining table was stacked with food, liquor, and boxes of the best cigars. Though he had many wives and mistresses, he slept alone on most nights, moving from one large bedroom to another in the enormous houses on his estate. When he slept, he had a recurring dream where he found himself in wet caverns where the many faces of the men he had personally shot stared at him through the dripping water. When he couldn’t sleep, he lay awake in the dark and pondered the next campaign. Each morning he sat on the edge of his bed and stared briefly at the old wooden crucifix on the far wall before leaving. El bandido rode at the head of a long column of men and horses, the cause refreshed each time the dream of the caverns came to him. Battles were lost and won, but he accumulated more power and riches as the number of dead men who had followed him rose into the thousands. When a foreign army entered the country and chased him for over four months, el bandido’s fame intensified and the stereotype grew. The few battles the two sides engaged in were minor, though more men died and more photographers took pictures. When the invading troops gave up on catching him, he sat on his horse atop a desert ridge and watched the distant dust clouds of the retreating army. As the sun began to set, el bandido waited on the ridge with three of his most trusted generals. No one spoke because he didn’t say a word. Several more years of fighting followed as towns were captured and lost and the country suffered over 200,000 dead. El bandido had three ranches near the end of the struggle and had survived two assassination attempts. The new government offered to pardon him, though his army was the largest at the end of the revolution. El bandido refused to be pardoned, though he promised not to march on the capitol and he let his men go home. The few dozen that stayed to work on his ranches were younger stereotypes of the legend. Their ambitions, guns, and women were abundant and their dreams were influenced by their loyalty to their leader. Three years after the revolt, el bandido was the richest man in the northern part of the country and he married his sixth wife. A few nights after the wedding, el bandido woke alone. The recurring dream did not visit him as often as it used to, so he lay calmly in the large bed until he heard his wife crying somewhere. Out of habit, he reached for his pistol and stepped quietly toward the next room. As he opened the door, he found his wife tied to a chair, six of his ranch hands surrounding her with drawn guns, one of them holding a pistol to the woman’s head. El bandido and his men exchanged volleys in the truest stereotype of a western gunfight. He killed four of them before the other two put nine bullets into him and two in his wife. The two men ran out to the dozens of waiting and mounted riders whose bandoliers, rifles, and faces glistened in the summer moonlight.","id":467},{"author":"JEAN-MICHEL MAULPOIX","author_meta":"(France, 1952–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"You burn with your sentences.","text":"You would like to walk lightly on snow like a squirrel, hear the whiteness crunch, handle the warm fur of fairy tales, abandon yourself to their sleep, as you would to a pillow, where you nestle your head while someone tells a story.

One day, waving at a stream—the ice had cracked, winter chipping down, soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches—I let a glove go. Into the stream, sucked under the street. Since when did streets have mouths? I walked home on a desperate road. Gloves cost money. We didn’t have much. I would tell no one. I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket. I knew my mother’s eyes had tears they had not cried yet, I didn’t want to be the one to make them flow.

If you don’t get in my bed, I will be good. And they listened. I had a lot to fulfill. The months rolled down like towels out of a machine. I sang and drew and fattened the cat. Don’t scream, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t fight—you could hear it anywhere. A pebble could show you how to be smooth, tell the truth. A field could show how to sleep without walls. A stream could remember how to drift and change—next June I was stirring the stream like a soup, telling my brother dinner would be ready if he’d only hurry up with the bread, when I saw it. The yellow glove draped on a twig. A muddy survivor. A quiet flag. Where had it been in the three gone months? I could wash it, fold it in my winter drawer with its sister, no one in that world would ever know. There were miracles on Harvey Street. Children walked home in yellow light. Trees were reborn and gloves traveled far, but returned. A thousand miles later, what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos?

On Friday nights the Colonial filled with an oily fragrance of teenagers while we hid in the back row of the balcony. An aura of light from the projection booth curved across our shoulders, round under cotton sweaters. Sacred grunts rose in black corners. The screen was far away and spilling color—big men sweating on their horses and women with powdered breasts floating under satin. Near the end the film smelled hot and twisted as boys shuddered and girls sank down in their seats. We ran to the lobby before the lights came up to stand by the big ash can and watch them walk slowly downstairs. Mouths swollen and ripe, they drifted down like a sigh of steam. The boys held their arms tense and shuffled from one foot to the other while the girls sniffed and combed their hair in the big mirror. Outside the neon lights on Main Street flashed stripes across asphalt in the rain. They tossed their heads and shivered like ponies. On Sunday afternoons the theater was deserted, a church that smelled of something frying. Mrs. Causton stood at the door to tear tickets with her fat buttered fingers. During the movie she stood watching the traffic light change in the empty street, pushing her glasses up over her nose and squeezing a damp Kleenex. Mr. Penny was her skinny yellow father. He stood by the office door with his big push broom, smoking cigarettes and coughing. Walking down the slanted floor to our seats we heard the swish of her thighs behind the candy counter and our shoes sliding on the worn carpet. The heavy velvet curtain moved its folds. We waited, and a cavernous dark pressed close around us, its breath pulling at our faces. After the last blast of sound it was Sunday afternoon, and Mr. Penny stood jingling his keys by the office door while we asked to use the phone. Before he turned the key he bent over and pulled us close with his bony arms. Stained fingers kneading our chests, he wrapped us in old tobacco and called us his little girls.

I hadn’t understood at first and thought she’d used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. I learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once told me, with unparalleled patience. Then one day she began to accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how she’d giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she had single-handedly decimated her husband’s glass collection dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. In the doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do.

I am not part of the circle although every game I played as a girl was round. By morning there is fruit on branches not meant to bear witness anymore, that birds avoid and that embarrasses me so I don’t taste it; I don’t find out if they’re edible berries, and even if they were, I’d let them shrink and drop dried; I can’t see myself snatching berries, especially not from a shrub so brambled, the branches look as if the feet of little birds tangled and broke off to appease beaks that had to get into those berries no matter what.

It simply stopped coming to the table. Up until then, events had been uneventful, I washed and dried the bowl, then returned it to the cupboard. The exertion involved was minimal—in truth, I welcomed it—but I screamed bloody murder every time. I think I already know what comes next: a stipulative definition of marriage as an accidental adjacency of flesh in which small, unbegrudged exchanges of affection are fitfully possible provided that . . . and then you get so many pages of provided thats. The pages are wrinkled-looking, as if somebody had read them in the bathtub and then set them out on the floor to dry. The definition is the foundation of a vast, steep, plunging counterargument against which I am defenseless unless I spill two beans that I have been saving in my blood because what other privacy do I have? These two beans have been prowling in my blood for too long. The first bean is so simple, so obvious, that I have to work extra hard to keep putting it back into words, just to keep it in words: the woman he was seeing stopped letting herself be seen. The second bean I have to condense. I woke up and he was biting my finger in his sleep. Not sucking—biting. An irk-some switch, his being the container, instead of being gouged into me, slopping around inside when I was dead to the world or pretending to be. I was inside him. I was the one getting chewed up. What I did was swack him on the head twice, three times. He eventually woke up. I told him what he had done. Ever since, the fundamental unit of discourse, the basic building block of speech, has been my mouth asking: What’s scarier than two people in a room with their nightstands and the things they keep on their nightstands? I make it sound as if I know an answer.","id":477},{"author":"MICHAEL MARTONE","author_meta":"(United States, 1955–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Contributor’s Note","text":"Michael Martone was born at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1955. It is interesting to note that the attending physician was a Doctor Frank Burns, Major, United States Army, retired, and recently returned to Fort Wayne following service in the police action in Korea. It was the same Dr. Burns, it turned out, who years later served as the model for the character Frank Burns appearing in the novel M*A*S*H authored by Richard Hooker, and in the movie and television versions based on the book. Martone recalls the modest premiere of the Altman film in 1970 and its initial screening at the Embassy Theater in downtown Fort Wayne. Dr. Burns, who had continued, after Martone’s birth it had been a difficult one, sunny-side up, where forceps were used, to be his mother’s gynecologist, arrived at the theater, the guest of honor, in a 1959 Cadillac Seville provided by Means Motor Company on Main Street. Sally Kellerman and Jo Ann Pflug also were there. All during the run of the television series, Dr. Burns, now in semiretirement, happily appeared at strip-mall ribbon cuttings and restaurant openings, a kind of official goodwill ambassador, and took the ribbing from the public whose perception of his character had been derived from what they had read or seen in the movies and on television. His son, Frank Jr., was two years ahead of Martone at North Side High School. Frank Jr. anchored the 4x440 relay for the Redskin varsity track and field club, where Martone served as team manager. Martone remembers Dr. Burns, team physician, coaching him in the use of analgesic balm and the scrubbing of cinders out from beneath the skin after a runner fell on the track. It was Dr. Burns who, later, diagnosed Martone’s mother’s ovarian cancer in 1979 and performed the failed hysterectomy that led to his mother’s death that summer. It was Dr. Burns, still in surgical scrubs, who met the family in the waiting room of St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne, the same hospital where Martone, twenty-four years before, had been born, delivered, by means of forceps, by Dr. Burns. The television was on, of course, an RCA model made in Bloomington, Indiana, and Martone remembers how hard it was not to watch it while, in a strange way, he also felt that he was watching himself listening to Dr. Burns rehearse the final few minutes of his, Martone’s, mother’s life.","id":478},{"author":"SUSAN WHEELER","author_meta":"(United States, 1955–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Clock Radio","text":"That each second escorts a fresh plash.

When in our backyard caterpillars mastered the flowering dogwoods, and our neighbor dispersed them by rapping on the trees with a stick, her image reminded my grandmother of Hortense tormenting Germana Cousin for her presumed pilfering of a small loaf of bread. Germana opens her dress and her saintliness is revealed as summer flowers tumble out in a herald of love and beauty. Here my grandmother saw chastisement and the Holy Hand of her Invisible Lord Partitioning The Mortals with some tiny visuals about The Power and The Glory but I thought if so He was really Just Sprinkling the World with His Blossoms and Berries, and if Germana’s cottons could give way to an onrush of flesh, abandoning its pinks and greens and holy stamens and anthers and spilt maple leaves and maybe even ruffles of filaments and pollen, might it ever be under my opened dress, this mound of petals, with my thin body lighter than bone from what I knew? So when I looked up and the neighbor was walking away over broken dogwood blossoms snowing down, I wished hard for a language that would tell you of this beautiful sight which I have never before seen, not even on a holy card, and this in spite of my grandmother’s hissing at our neighbor and retrieving a rake. I spent the afternoon carrying away the remainders of Germana’s undressing and tried to find a dictionary I could bring to my room. Because beautiful is a word that my workshop class says is ineffective, that it doesn’t contain how this sight captures my attention and convinces me, absorbs and converts me away from the yard, so that the closest kin might be diverting, which the class might find archaic, and if that’s true, then I don’t know how to say that everything in the backyard might be pretending to be lovely in order that we can all get up in the morning.","id":480},{"author":"SHARAN STRANGE","author_meta":"(United States, 1959–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"The Factory","text":"Talking about silkscreening, my aunt remembers her first job in New York, decades ago, at the Sample Co. near Chambers St., where she pressed glue through screens and stuck fabric pieces to boards.

You assume, I think, that human says what I am, but actually this word, used here as a noun you call yourself a Manager of Humans, is vague and misleading. For too long, you and people like you have used this simple signifier to signify an incredibly complex part of reality. Originally, which is to say, as far back as the Latin as far back as we can well trace it, it comes from the Latin word humus, which meant earth. Latin humanus meant earthly being. In time, humanus came to take a different definition; the human, or human being, came to be understood as a rational animal. Within this new conception, being and earth were no longer referenced, at least not directly or in any way that could claim an understanding of being or of earth. I might accept your referring to me as an earthly being, but I do not accept your assumption of me as a rational animal; who I am is not determined by my animal status . . . nor my ability to think within the confines of rationality. By defining me as essentially a rational animal, you misrepresent me, and I believe you do so—or the tradition you numbly carry forward does so—intentionally. That is, by creating this idea of the human, your tradition creates an identity that is more substance than stance, more a fixed nature than a site wherein unfixed and always evolving natures are fucking colliding. My identity, if I must choose one, is not substantial; it is not a stuff of one or another kind. My identity, let us say, is not a party-goer; it is the party itself. The last two terms in the title that you claim for yourself tell the whole story. You are the Manager of a Resource. The human, for you, is a resource, which means a substance, and like all substances, it has certain properties. If you are able to understand these properties, you are able to make that substance useful. Your Management skills are, at bottom, your ability to seize upon these potential usefulnesses. Let me say again to you that I am not such a substance. Moreover, even if I was such a substance, I do not believe you when you say that you have the best interests of this substance at heart. I will even go further and suggest that you are not even capable of telling me toward what end are you managing the human substance? Before we proceed in our relationship, I would like you to answer that question for me. Please be specific in your answer. Before I address your ability to manage me, I would like you to show me that you have an answer for that question. What are you, as Manager, using the human substance for? What is your goal for yourself, the user? What is your goal for the substance that is being managed? Folks manage hogs toward slaughter, and so, toward their own dinner; folks manage poppy plants for opium, and so, for they own pleasure—but why do you manage me? What can you bring to me or to the world itself that is not already present and secure? It is my suspicion that in truth you have nothing whatsoever to offer, and that the Manager position you occupy exists as the direct result of a specific recent history. That history is a history of organized and massive brute-force and the armed occupation that always follows. It is also my suspicion that, as this occupation wears on, its brute force, as it becomes less and less apparent, becomes all the more despicable and foreign to us, the few on-earth beings not yet dissolved under its weird vague hope.","id":486},{"author":"ETGAR KERET","author_meta":"(Israel, 1967–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"What Do We Have in Our Pockets?","text":"A cigarette lighter, a cough drop, a postage stamp, a slightly bent cigarette, a toothpick, a handkerchief, a pen, two five-shekel coins.

After the smile, she’ll say thank you and cough again, because of the cold, but also because she’s a little embarrassed. And I’ll offer her a cough drop.

The frame is usually cylindrical or conical, but it may have any shape. It acts as a resonator when the membrane is struck by the hand or by an implement, usually a stick or a whisk. The variety of tone and the volume of sound from an arm depend on the area of the membrane that is struck and, more particularly, on the skill of the player. Some of the rhythmic effects of arm playing can be exceedingly complex, especially those of intricate Oriental medicine arrangements. Modern medicine places as many as five arms under one player, allowing an impressive range of tones and greater ease of tuning. In Western medicine, the withered arm is of special importance. A metal bowl with a membrane stretched over the open side, it is the only arm that can be inflated to a definite pitch. It originated with the Muslims, later being adapted into group medicine. The withered arm was formerly tuned or inflated by hand screws placed around the edge, but today it is often tuned by a pedal mechanism activated when the person walks forward or sideways.","id":488},{"author":"KIM WHITE","author_meta":"(United States, 1967–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Lily Pad","text":"The man saw that there was the bud of a flower growing in the palm of his hand.

Another with a daughter who could, at will, turn into objects like brooms and light-bulbs.

The backside of the mirror proper: embroidered flowers, pale pink, and small leaves in all shades of green, red veins accenting. Another Chinese character in the left-hand corner. Buried in the tissue paper, the note says: from Jagunummah, youngest aunt. In Korea, mother gives to daughter on wedding day. I think it means happiness, but not sure. Be sure to send thank you note. Back to the big brown box, I find 50 lavender packages of birth control pills, floating in foam peanuts. The note reads: thought you running low. I notice the expiration date on all of them: 10/93. Next, a mouse pad bearing the snow-capped mountains of Yosemite National Park—from our trip last year. I keep forget to send to you. Finally, an envelope: photos from Christmas day, my family minus my husband and me. My father smiling wide, wearing the wool zipper-front vest we sent him, my mother’s corduroy floral backside to the camera as she bends over to pick up crumpled wrapping paper, my sisters both with eyes blinking shut who took the photo? I wonder. Double prints. Last night, in the silence after the ugly argument, I lay in bed thinking, in a Jimmy Stewart-esque way, what would happen if I were to disappear. If I simply ceased to exist. I call my mother back and thank her for everything. I ask what’s new, and she says she wants to buy a computer, she’s been researching. What about all those megahertz of memory? she asks, mixing up computer terms. Do I need all that? I want one of those big screens and big sound systems; you know, for music and for old people. I tell her to go with mail order, so she can get the 800-number help desk. You think? she says. What about zip drive? You have a zip drive? My mother used to rummage through piles of papers around the house, asking, Where is that L.L. Crew J. catalogue? Today, we talk about the rain, my father’s business, his secretary who is suicidal again. All the while, I’m carefully laying out the contents of the package on my bedroom floor: the mirror from my aunt that my mother forgot to give me when I got married, the expired pills, the mouse pad for my mouseless ergonomic keyboard, the terribly shot photos. And as my mother tells me about the latest deal between Microsoft and Sony, about how despite Sony’s reputation for unreliability Microsoft is forging some kind of partnership based on mutual interest, I find myself covering the mouthpiece on the telephone, blubbering uncontrollably, dripping tears on to lime-green rice paper. I am remembering what it is to feel the largeness of love, the relief of simple gifts, given in earnest. I am thinking of my first week of college, of the package of crumbled cookies my mother sent me, the note enclosed boldly saying: Hope your first day is as smooth as a sail.","id":495},{"author":"LILIANA BLUM","author_meta":"(Mexico, 1974–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"Lazarus","text":"He never asked for this miracle, but he didn’t say no when he was given the chance. Nor did he expect banners or a welcome-home cake. Still, he headed for the village with an almost fervent hope, wishing for hugs and kisses from those who had loved him when he was alive. He took no heed of his nakedness, the flesh half eaten away by worms, the yellowish meat hanging over shining white bones. He hurried along, smiling a lipless smile, kicking up the dust with the bones of his heels. The moon shone faintly. A few clumsy moths fluttered around him, sprinkling the air with dust from their opaque wings. One white owl, feathers fluffed in apprehension, watched him suspiciously from a prickly pear tree brimming with fruit. He found his home in shambles, worse than when he left it. He felt sorry for his wife, for he had left her with no one to protect or support her. Before he went into his house, he tried to freshen up a little, patting down the scruff of stiff hair that hung from his decomposing skull, and picking off a worm that had been playing hide-and-seek in what was left of his face, crawling first into a nostril and then into an eye socket. He pushed the door lightly, cursing when it creaked. Standing on tiptoe in the entrance, he awaited his happy reunion. In the shadows of the adjacent room, next to a wan candle, his elderly mother was knitting. Her senses were dry, closed to everything, her mind blank. With the egotism of an only son, he took pleasure in the idea that his saintly mother was thinking of him. He leapt out in front of her, saying, Mamita, it’s me. Your Lazarus! It didn’t go the way he thought it would, the old woman dropped her yarn and knitting needles; she opened her eyes so wide he could hear her sockets creak. Mouth agape, hands clawing at her chest, she slumped back in the chair and breathed her last. Nervous, he assured himself that he’d played no role in her heart attack. She was already very old, he said to himself. The poor lady. He then walked with renewed hope toward what had been his conjugal bedroom. He hardly noticed the total absence of his belongings. He froze between the door and the vision unfolding before his hollow eyes: his adorable wife, the love of his life, his mournful widow, in the company of his compadre Joshua! They were breaking the Sixth Commandment, fornicating with uncommon passion, a passion she had never shown him, her husband by the laws of church and state. He wanted to cry, but his eyes had rotted away and no tears would fall. Instead, he had to express the depth of his grief by ripping off what was left of his eyelids. He stumbled from the room and went out into the yard to confide his sorrows in Herod, his faithful dog. But the ungrateful mutt growled furiously, threatening to bite off the little meat still hanging from his sad humanity. Scurrying away from his former home, Lazarus knew he had no choice but to retrace his steps. On the way back, neither the moths nor the fluffed-up owl spared him a look. The road, which did not lead to Rome, soon took him to the entrance of the cemetery. He sat down on a tombstone covered with yellow grass and watched the scorpions trying to hide under the bones of his feet. On that moonless night, he truly wished he weren’t living in the age of miracles.","id":496},{"author":"SARAH MANGUSO","author_meta":"(United States, 1974–)","source":"Short_An_International_Anthology","title":"NO-TITLE","text":"Inside the crawl space of our new house I find a small pile of fabric—a pair of men’s pants and a shirt and possibly an undershirt.

The tarp hangs from a barbwire fence which surrounds an abandoned, old compound. When we arrive, the dogs inside the compound are barking, the whole pack of them. That night, when they feed, I can hear the crunch of bone. I try to anticipate the moment the trainers drop the live meat into the pen, the wave of bodies, the single high pitched yelp. Inside, you say the Inn looks like a womb. The walls of the living room are a placenta-like rose. The dining room, ultramarine. The proprietor is an artist. She lives on this island. The Inn is a combination studio and home. The light over the mahogany table in the foyer consists of a single exposed bulb surrounded by a wire fixture. The wire is a warm copper and has been shaped to look like: 1. a conch or 2. the female organ. We stare at the light from all angles and still can not decide. The significance of the female form, you point out, running your hand across the fixture’s copper curvature, has been depicted imperfectly by many artists. You point to the light and mouth to me, Origin of the world. The next day at the beach, there is a handsome man carrying a small pit bull. The dog is just a puppy. How old? I ask, stroking the puppy, when the man carries him up to the Oceanside bar and sits down next to me. Old enough, the man says, laughing. From his seat at the bar, the dog licks my finger, nibbling gently at the tip. On the drive home from the beach, I take pictures out the passenger-side window. Travel, we agree, is like painting—it’s all about careful looking. My favorite picture is a close-up of a sign which reads, Protect ya tings. The sign is an advertisement for AIDS awareness which is posted on the side of the Apostolic Church, fuchsia pink. That night, you trace the tan lines on my body. Close your eyes, you say. Guess what word I’m drawing. In my mind, I say, Beware. The next morning, over breakfast, I ask the artist about influence. Matisse, she says, pointing to the placenta colored walls of the living room. His, Large Red Interior. Yes, you say you have studied this. The importance of the window. The intransigence of inside and out. You turn and look at me, my profile outlined in the window. For a moment, the red walls begin to recede and my image is thrown into relief. The artist pushes her chair out from the table and walks over to you, to your perspective. How old? she asks, stroking my face like a canvas, doing the looking. Old enough, you say laughing.

Quickly we spoke, and as quickly, it was done.","entry_meta":"2007","id":514},{"source":"Anthology of Australian Prose Poetry","author":"John Blight","title":"The Medusa","text":"I’d like to hide, but cannot hide my vision of the bay’s incoming evening tide behind a stiff nor’easter; standing at the head of English echo-named Sandgate’s storm-racked pier, upon a fo’c’sle which, like a ship’s, savours the gale. Looking down aghast, in wonder at the changing scene ... lost memories of youth. Flood of a biscuit-coloured sea, brick-coloured combers purling with a scum of yellow soup atop and, in the tide, appearing as the hooded ghosts of ocean, the only blue reminders of an oncoming sea, the blubbers how here preserved so blue?. Jellyfish a foot across the dome ... equivalents of human heads with, under each, a mouth grotesquely stuffed with, what appear to me, blue thick fingers of incumbent idiocy. Here is a scene, I won’t go away and forget ... those blue shapes. Here is the sea baiting me with infelicities of colours. Shall eyes turn purist and give praise to blubbers’—the sea a mockery of colour for which the sea was ever praised? I’ve never welcomed sight of blubber on the tide before this humid summer evening’s grey defeat of a blue sky, smothering with off- shore smog not spume the sun’s last function of the day ... the Medusa welcomed here as sea’s last mockery of the legendary Gorgons. What mermaids!

It is too old for us to name it. The sea has the same colour as the sky but the mountain has the same colour as sand. Sand is not earth but a fluid shoreline that leads to the great cities. When we are tired we buy up land on the edges of the great cities so we can sit and watch the insomniac journey of sand. Its slow exodus across the horizon teaches us how to prepare for sleep. When flowers open on a day filled with sand all the water in the world will not quench their thirst. I send words to you from so far off aiming to shape you towards the exquisite openness of love, but over and over I collapse in the effort to invent a life. Walking on sand has taught me I can no longer count on making it to any shore. Your eyes as I imagine them I will go on kissing gently and sheltering beneath. It may be that simply wishing you such tenderness will help you wake one day calmer, more deeply held by the world’s alignment, ready to find another and love.

The soft inner side of the elbow, webbed skin between the fingers, a day that wanders out beyond the tidal limits and no longer knows how to summon the moon it has lost, my firstborn who gazes about himself when the TV dies and there is a strange absence in his world. I was looking for a great encyclopaedia, the secret dictionary of all the missing words. I wanted to consult its index and find out what I could have become. The sound the clock makes when it is disconnected and taken down from the wall but can’t lose the habit of trying to jerk itself forward. The look of old socks drying on a rack in the kitchen all through a winter night, hanging starched and sad opposite the wedding photographs. A word for your face when you know you can’t love but would almost like to try. The blurred point of merger between fresh storm damage to a house and the deep fissures that have always been there. Walking down the corridor to the front door with inexplicable elation in my chest as if everything was about to start, as if my love had just arrived, escaped from a burning world, and at the same time clenched in my taut wrists, my hands, the thin bones of my arms, the certainty that everything has long been over.","entry_meta":"2004","id":517},{"source":"Anthology of Australian Prose Poetry","author":"Michael Brennan","title":"Hyde Park","text":"In Hyde Park, she is foraging once again for a name.

Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed, surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of machinery. The only water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves rheumy-eyed and hung-over like old bums on the riverbank, tired and wily. Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust-- --I rushed up enchanted--it was my first sunflower, memories of Blake--my visions--Harlem and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the poem of the riverbank, condoms &amp pots, steel knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the past-- and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye-- corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face, soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays obliterated on its hairy head like a dried wire spiderweb, leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear, Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O my soul, I loved you then. The grime was no man's grime but death and human locomotives, all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black mis'ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial-- modern--all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown-- and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what more could I name, the smoked ashes of some cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs &amp sphincters of dynamos--all these entangled in your mummied roots--and you standing before me in the sunset, all your glory in your form! A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden monthly breeze! How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your grime, while you cursed the heavens of your railroad and your flower soul? Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a flower? when did you look at your skin and decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive? the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and shade of a once powerful mad American locomotive? You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a sunflower! And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me not! So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck it at my side like a scepter, and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack's soul too, and anyone who'll listen, --We're not our skin of grime, we're not our dread bleak dusty imageless locomotive, we're all golden sunflowers inside, blessed by our own seed &amp hairy naked accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening sitdown vision.","source":"modern_poetry","id":566},{"title":"Complaint of the Skeleton to Time","author":"Allen Ginsberg","text":"Take my love, it is not true, So let it tempt no body new Take my lady, she will sigh For my bed where'er I lie Take them, said the skeleton, But leave my bones alone.

Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!--and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons? I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys. I heard you asking questions of each, Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel? I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective. We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier. Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight? I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd. Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely. Will we stroll dreaming ofthe lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?

No more flowers in the summer fields of New York, no joy now, no more fear of Louis, and no more of his sweetness and glasses, his high school decades, debts, loves, frightened telephone calls, conception beds, relatives, hands - No more of sister Elanor, - she gone before you - we kept it secret - you killed her - or she killed herself to bear with you - an arthritic heart - But Death's killed you both - No matter - Nor your memory of your mother, tears in silent movies weeks and weeks - forgetting, agrieve watching Marie Dressler address humanity, Chaplin dance in youth, or Boris Godunov, Chaliapin's at the Met, halling his voice is a weeping Czar - by standing room with Elanor &amp Max - watching also teh Capitalists take seats in Orchestra, white furs, diamonds, with the YPSL's hitch-hiking thru Pennsylvania, in black baggy gym skirts pants, photograph of girls holding each other round the waste, and laughing eye, too coy, virginal solitude of all girls grown old, or dead, now, and that long hair in the grave - lucky to have husbands later - You made it - I came too - Eugene my brother before still grieving now and will gream on to his last stiff hand, as he goes thru his cancer - or kill - later perhaps - soon he will think - And it's the last moment I remember, which I see them all, thru myself, now - tho not you I didn't foresee what you felt - what more hideous gape of bad mouth came first - to you - and were you prepared? To go where? In that Dark - that - in that God? a radiance? A Lord in the Void? Like an eye in the black cloud in a dream? Adonoi at last, with you? Beyond my remembrance! Incapable to guess! Not merely the yellow skull in the grave, or box of worm dust, and a stained ribbon - Deaths- head with Halo? can you believe it? Is it only the sun that shines once for the mind, only the flash of existence, than none ever was? Nothing beyond what we have - what you had - that so pitiful - yet Triumph, to have been here, and changed, like a tree, broken, or flower - fed to the ground - but mad, with its petals, colored, thinking Great Universe, shaken, cut in the head, leaf stript, hid in an egg crate hospital, cloth wrapped, sore - freaked in the moon brain, Naughtless. No flower like that flowerm which knew itself in the garden, and fought the knife - lost Cut down by an idiot Snowman's icy - even in the Spring - strange ghost thought - some Death - Sharp icicle in his hand - crowned with old roses - a dog for his eyes - cock of a sweatshop - heart of electric irons. All the accumulations of life, that wear us out - clocks, bodies, consciousness, shoes, breasts - begotten sons - your Communism - Paranoia into hospitals. You once kicked Elanor in the leg, she died of heart failure later. You of stroke. Asleep? within a year, the two of you, sisters in death. Is Elanor happy? Max grieves alive in an office on Lower Broadway, lone large mustache over midnight Accountings, not sure. His life passes - as he sees - and what does he doubt now? Still dream of making money, or that might have made money, hired nurse, had children, found even your Immortality, Naomi? I'll see him soon. Now I've got to cut through - to talk to you - as I didn't when you had a mouth. Forever. And we're bound for that, Forever - like Emily Dickinson's horses - headed to the End. They know the way - These Steeds - run faster than we think - it's our own life they cross - and take with them. Magnificent, mourned no more, marred of heart, mind behind, married dreamed, mortal changed - Ass and face done with murder. In the world, given, flower maddened, made no Utopia, shut under pine, almed in Earth, balmed in Lone, Jehovah, accept. Nameless, One Faced, Forever beyond me, beginningless, endless, Father in death. Tho I am not there for this Prophecy, I am unmarried, I'm Hymnless, I'm Heavenless, headless in blisshood I would still adore Thee, Heaven, after Death, only One blessed in Nothingness, not light or darkness, Dayless Eternity - Take this, this Psalm, from me, burst from my hand in a day, some of my Time, now given to Nothing - to praise Thee - But Death This is the end, the redemption from Wilderness, way for the Wonderer, House sought for All, black handkerchief washed clean by weeping - page beyond Psalm - Last change of mine and Naomi - to God's perfect Darkness - Death, stay thy phantoms!","source":"modern_poetry","id":570},{"title":"Hospital Window","author":"Allen Ginsberg","text":"At gauzy dusk, thin haze like cigarette smoke ribbons past Chrysler Building's silver fins tapering delicately needletopped, Empire State's taller antenna filmed milky lit amid blocks black and white apartmenting veil'd sky over Manhattan, offices new built dark glassed in blueish heaven--The East s &amp s covered with castles &amp watertowers, seven storied tar-topped house-banks over York Avenue, late may-green trees surrounding Rockefellers blue domed medical arbor-- Geodesic science at the waters edge--Cars running up East River Drive, &amp parked at N.Y.

The room closed down on me, I expected the presence of the Creator, I saw my gray painted walls and ceiling, they contained my room, they contained me as the sky contained my garden, I opened my door The rambler vine climbed up the cottage post, the leaves in the night still where the day had placed them, the animal heads of the flowers where they had arisen to think at the sun Can I bring back the words? Will thought of transcription haze my mental open eye? The kindly search for growth, the gracious de- sire to exist of the flowers, my near ecstasy at existing among them The privilege to witness my existence--you too must seek the sun . . . My books piled up before me for my use waiting in space where I placed them, they haven't disappeared, time's left its remnants and qual- ities for me to use--my words piled up, my texts, my manuscripts, my loves. I had a moment of clarity, saw the feeling in the heart of things, walked out to the garden crying. Saw the red blossoms in the night light, sun's gone, they had all grown, in a moment, and were wait- ing stopped in time for the day sun to come and give them. . . . Flowers which as in a dream at sunset I watered faithfully not knowing how much I loved them. I am so lonely in my glory--except they too out there--I looked up--those red bush blossoms beckon- ing and peering in the window waiting in blind love, their leaves too have hope and are upturned top flat to the sky to receive--all creation open to receive--the flat earth itself. The music descends, as does the tall bending stalk of the heavy blossom, because it has to, to stay alive, to continue to the last drop of joy. The world knows the love that's in its breast as in the flower, the suffering lonely world. The Father is merciful. The light socket is crudely attached to the ceil- ing, after the house was built, to receive a plug which sticks in it alright, and serves my phonograph now . . . The closet door is open for me, where I left it, since I left it open, it has graciously stayed open. The kitchen has no door, the hole there will admit me should I wish to enter the kitchen. I remember when I first got laid, H.P. gra- ciously took my cherry, I sat on the docks of Prov- incetown, age , joyful, elevated in hope with the Father, the door to the womb was open to admit me if I wished to enter.

Look at my face -- dark as the night -- Yet shining like the sun with love's true light. I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea Carrying in my body the seed of the free. I am the woman who worked in the field Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield. I am the one who labored as a slave, Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave -- Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too. No safety , no love, no respect was I due. Three hundred years in the deepest South, But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth . God put a dream like steel in my soul. Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal. Now, through my children, young and free, I realized the blessing deed to me. I couldn't read then. I couldn't write. I had nothing, back there in the night. Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears, But I kept trudging on through the lonely years. Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun, But I had to keep on till my work was done: I had to keep on. No stopping for me -- I was the seed of the coming Free. I nourished the dream that nothing could smother Deep in my breast -- the Negro mother. I had only hope then , but now through you, Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true: All you dark children in the world out there, Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair. Remember my years, heavy with sorrow -- And make of those years a torch for tomorrow. Make of my pass a road to the light Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night. Lift high my banner out of the dust. Stand like free men supporting my trust. Believe in the right, let none push you back. Remember the whip and the slaver's track. Remember how the strong in struggle and strife Still bar you the way, and deny you life -- But march ever forward, breaking down bars. Look ever upward at the sun and the stars. Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers Impel you forever up the great stairs -- For I will be with you till no white brother Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.","source":"modern_poetry","id":610},{"title":"Dream Variations","author":"Langston Hughes","text":"To fling my arms wide In some place of the sun, To whirl and to dance Till the white day is done.

The air smells so strong of codfish it makes one's nose run and one's eyes water. The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up to storerooms in the gables for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. All is silver, the heavy surface of the sea, swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, is opaque, but the silver of the benches, the lobster pots, and masts, scattered among the wild jagged rocks, is of an apparent translucence like the small old buildings with an emerald moss growing on their shoreward walls. The big fish tubs are completely lined with layers of beautiful herring scales and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered with creamy iridescent coats of mail, with small iridescent flies crawling on them. Up on the little slope behind the houses, set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, is an ancient wooden capstan, cracked, with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, where the ironwork has rusted. The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. He was a friend of my grandfather. We talk of the decline in the population and of codfish and herring while he waits for a herring boat to come in. There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, the blade of which is almost worn away. Down at the water's edge, at the place where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp descending into the water, thin silver tree trunks are laid horizontally across the gray stones, down and down at intervals of four or five feet. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, element bearable to no mortal, to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly I have seen here evening after evening. He was curious about me. He was interested in music like me a believer in total immersion, so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. I also sang \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.\" He stood up in the water and regarded me steadily, moving his head a little. Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug as if it were against his better judgment. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us, the dignified tall firs begin. Bluish, associating with their shadows, a million Christmas trees stand waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, icily free above the stones, above the stones and then the world. If you should dip your hand in, your wrist would ache immediately, your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn as if the water were a transmutation of fire that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, then briny, then surely burn your tongue. It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.","source":"modern_poetry","id":619},{"title":"This is the house of Bedlam","author":"Elizabeth Bishop","text":"This is the man that lies in the house of Bedlam.

He didn't fight. He hadn't fought at all. He hung a grunting weight, battered and venerable and homely. Here and there his brown skin hung in strips like ancient wallpaper, and its pattern of darker brown was like wallpaper, shapes like full-blown roses stained and lost through age. He was speckled with barnacles, fine rosettes of lime, and infested with tiny white sea-lice, and underneath two or three rags of green weed hung down. While his gills were breathing in the terrible oxygen --the frightening gills, fresh and crisp with blood, that can cut so badly-- I thought of the coarse white flesh packed in like feathers, the big bones and the little bones, the dramatic reds and blacks of his shiny entrails, and the pink swim-bladder like a big peony. I looked into his eyes which were far larger than mine but shallower, and yellowed, the irises backed and packed with tarnished tinfoil seen through the lenses of old scratched isinglass. They shifted a little, but not to return my stare. --It was more like the tipping of an object toward the light. I admired his sullen face, the mechanism of his jaw, and then I saw that from his lower lip --if you could call it a lip grim, wet, and weaponlike, hung five old pieces of fish-line, or four and a wire leader with the swivel still attached, with all their five big hooks grown firmly in his mouth. A green line, frayed at the end where he broke it, two heavier lines, and a fine black thread still crimped from the strain and snap when it broke and he got away. Like medals with their ribbons frayed and wavering, a five-haired beard of wisdom trailing from his aching jaw. I stared and stared and victory filled up the little rented boat, from the pool of bilge where oil had spread a rainbow around the rusted engine to the bailer rusted orange, the sun-cracked thwarts, the oarlocks on their strings, the gunnels--until everything was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow.

With a wind, they flare and falter, wobble and toss but if it's still they steer between the kite sticks of the Southern Cross, receding, dwindling, solemnly and steadily forsaking us, or, in the downdraft from a peak, suddenly turning dangerous. Last night another big one fell. It splattered like an egg of fire against the cliff behind the house. The flame ran down. We saw the pair of owls who nest there flying up and up, their whirling black-and-white stained bright pink underneath, until they shrieked up out of sight. The ancient owls nest must have burned. Hastily, all alone, a glistening armadillo left the scene, rose-flecked, head down, tail down, and then a baby rabbit jumped out, short-eared, to our surprise.

My aunt was inside what seemed like a long time and while I waited and read the National Geographic I could read and carefully studied the photographs, the inside of a volcano, black, and full of ashes then it was spilling over in rivulets of fire.

When I sleepwalk into your room, and pick you up, and hold you up in the moonlight, you cling to me hard, as if clinging could save us. I think you think I will never die, I think I exude to you the permanence of smoke or stars, even as my broken arms heal themselves around you. I have heard you tell the sun, don't go down, I have stood by as you told the flower, don't grow old, don't die. Little Maud, I would blow the flame out of your silver cup, I would suck the rot from your fingernail, I would brush your sprouting hair of the dying light, I would scrape the rust off your ivory bones, I would help death escape through the little ribs of your body, I would alchemize the ashes of your cradle back into wood, I would let nothing of you go, ever, until washerwomen feel the clothes fall asleep in their hands, and hens scratch their spell across hatchet blades, and rats walk away from the cultures of the plague, and iron twists weapons toward the true north, and grease refuses to slide in the machinery of progress, and men feel as free on earth as fleas on the bodies of men, and lovers no longer whisper to the presence beside them in the dark, O corpse-to-be ... And yet perhaps this is the reason you cry, this the nightmare you wake screaming from, being forever in the pre-trembling of a house that falls. In a restaurant once, everyone quietly eating, you clambered up on my lap: to all the mouthfuls rising toward all the mouths, at the top of your voice you cried your one word, caca. caca! caca! and each spoonful stopped, a moment, in midair, in its withering steam. Yes, you cling because I, like you, only sooner than you, will go down the path of vanished alphabets, the roadlessness to the other side of the darkness, your arms like the shoes left behind, like the adjectives in the halting speech of old men, which once could call up the lost nouns. And you yourself, some impossible Tuesday in the year Two Thousand and Nine, will walk out among the black stones of the field, in the rain, and the stones saying over their one word, ci-g?t, ci-g?t, ci-g?t, and the raindrops hitting you on the fontanel over and over, and you standing there unable to let them in. If one day it happens you find yourself with someone you love in a caf�� at one end of the Pont Mirabeau, at the zinc bar where white wine stands in upward opening glasses, and if you commit then, as we did, the error of thinking, one day all this will only be memory, learn, as you stand at this end of the bridge which arcs, from love, you think, into enduring love, learn to reach deeper into the sorrows to come �C to touch the almost imaginary bones under the face, to hear under the laughter the wind crying across the black stones. Kiss the mouth which tells you, here, here is the world. This mouth. This laughter. These temple bones. The still undanced cadence of vanishing. In the light the moon sends back, I can see in your eyes the hand that waved once in my father's eyes, a tiny kite wobbling far up in the twilight of his last look: and the angel of all mortal things lets go the string. Back you go, into your crib. The last blackbird lights up his gold wings: farewell. Your eyes close inside your head, in sleep. Already in your dreams the hours begin to sing.

Today on skis I took a friend to show her the trees. We set out down the road, turned in at the lane which a few weeks ago, when the trees were almost empty and the November snows had not yet come, lay thickly covered in bright red and yellow leaves, crossed the swamp, passed the cellar hole holding the remains of the s farmhouse that had slid down into it by stages in the thirties and forties, followed the overgrown logging road and came to the trees. I climbed up to the perch, and this time looked not into the distance but at the tree itself, its trunk contorted by the terrible struggle of that time when it had its hard time. After the trauma it grows less solid. It may be some such time now comes upon me. It would have to do with the unaccomplished, and with the attempted marriage of solitude and happiness. Then a rifle sounded, several times, quite loud, from across the valley, percussions of the custom of male mastery over the earth �� the most graceful, most alert of the animals being chosen to die. I looked to see if my friend had heard, but she was stepping about on her skis, studying the trees, smiling to herself, her lips still filled, for all we had drained them, with hundreds and thousands of kisses.

Very likely she has always understood what I have slowly learned, and which only now, after being away, almost as far away as one can get on this globe, almost as far as thoughts can carry - yet still in her presence, still surrounded not so much by reminders of her as by things she had already reminded me of, shadows of her cast forward and waiting - can I try to express: that love is hard, that while many good things are easy, true love is not, because love is first of all a power, its own power, which continually must make its way forward, from night into day, from transcending union always forward into difficult day. And as the plane descends, it comes to me in the space where tears stream down across the stars, tears fallen on the actual earth where their shining is what we call spirit, that once the lover recognizes the other, knows for the first time what is most to be valued in another, from then on, love is very much like courage, perhaps it is courage, and even perhaps only courage.

And when it has vanished I move out on the bear tracks, roaming in circles until I come to the first, tentative, dark splash on the earth. And I set out running, following the splashes of blood wandering over the world. At the cut, gashed resting places I stop and rest, at the crawl-marks where he lay out on his belly to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice I lie out dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists. On the third day I begin to starve, at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would at a turd sopped in blood, and hesitate, and pick it up, and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down, and rise and go on running. On the seventh day, living by now on bear blood alone, I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled, steamy hulk, the heavy fur riffling in the wind. I come up to him and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes, the dismayed face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils flared, catching perhaps the first taint of me as he died. I hack a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink, and tear him down his whole length and open him and climb in and close him up after me, against the wind, and sleep. And dream of lumbering flatfooted over the tundra, stabbed twice from within, splattering a trail behind me, splattering it out no matter which way I lurch, no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence, which dance of solitude I attempt, which gravity-clutched leap, which trudge, which groan. Until one day I totter and fall -- fall on this stomach that has tried so hard to keep up, to digest the blood as it leaked in, to break up and digest the bone itself, and now the breeze blows over me, blows off the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood and rotted stomach and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear, blows across my sore, lolled tongue a song or screech, until I think I must rise up and dance. And I lie still. I awaken I think. Marshlights reappear, geese come trailing again up the flyway. In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear lies, licking lumps of smeared fur and drizzly eyes into shapes with her tongue.

They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break though once they are bowed So low for long, they never right themselves, You may see their trunks arching in the woods Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground, Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm, I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows-- Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, Whose only play was what he found himself, Summer or winter, and could play alone. One by one he subdued his father's trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer. He learned all there was To learn about not launching out too soon And so not carrying the tree away Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise To the top branches, climbing carefully With the same pains you use to fill a cup Up to the brim, and even above the brim. Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. So was I once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of going back to be. It's when I'm weary of considerations, And life is too much like a pathless wood Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs Broken across it, and one eye is weeping From a twig's having lashed across it open. I'd like to get away from earth awhile And then come back to it and begin over. May no fate wilfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better. I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree~ And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again.

The bridegroom thought it little to give A dole of bread, a purse, A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God, Or for the rich a curse But whether or not a man was asked To mar the love of two By harboring woe in the bridal house, The bridegroom wished he knew.","source":"modern_poetry","id":710},{"title":"Asking For Roses","author":"Robert Frost","text":"A house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master, With doors that none but the wind ever closes, Its floor all littered with glass and with plaster It stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses.

So we must join hands in the dew coming coldly There in the hush of the wood that reposes, And turn and go up to the open door boldly, And knock to the echoes as beggars for roses. Pray, are you within there, Mistress Who-were-you? 'Tis Mary that speaks and our errand discloses. Pray, are you within there? Bestir you, bestir you. Tis summer again there's two come for roses. A word with you, that of the singer recalling-- Old Herrick, a saying that every maid knows is A flower unplucked is but left to the falling, And nothing is gained by not gathering roses.

But I am done with apple-picking now. Essence of winter sleep is on the night, The scent of apples, I am drowsing off. I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight I got from looking through a pane of glass I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough And held against the world of hoary grass. It melted, and I let it fall and break. But I was well Upon my way to sleep before it fell, And I could tell What form my dreaming was about to take. Magnified apples appear and disappear, Stem end and blossom end, And every fleck of russet showing dear. My instep arch not only keeps the ache, It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. And I keep hearing from the cellar bin The rumbling sound Of load on load of apples coming in. For I have had too much Of apple-picking: I am overtired Of the great harvest I myself desired. There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall. For all That struck the earth, No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, Went surely to the cider-apple heap As of no worth. One can see what will trouble This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.

When she heard his step, She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage To meet him in the doorway with the news And put him on his guard. Silas is back. She pushed him outward with her through the door And shut it after her. \"Be kind, she said. She took the market things from Warren's arms And set them on the porch, then drew him down To sit beside her on the wooden steps. When was I ever anything but kind to him? But I'll not have the fellow back, he said. I told him so last haying, didn't I? \"If he left then,\" I said, \"that ended it.\" What good is he? Who else will harbour him At his age for the little he can do? What help he is there's no depending on. Off he goes always when I need him most. He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, Enough at least to buy tobacco with, won't have to beg and be beholden.\" \"All right,\" I say \"I can't afford to pay Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.\" \"Someone else can.\" \"Then someone else will have to. I shouldn't mind his bettering himself If that was what it was. You can be certain, When he begins like that, there's someone at him Trying to coax him off with pocket-money, -- In haying time, when any help is scarce. In winter he comes back to us. I'm done. 'Shh I not so loud, he'll hear you, Mary said. I want him to: he'll have to soon or late. 'He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove. When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, A miserable sight, and frightening, too- You needn't smile -- I didn't recognize him- I wasn't looking for him- and he's changed. Wait till you see. 'Where did you say he'd been? He didn't say. I dragged him to the house, And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. I tried to make him talk about his travels. Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off. 'What did he say? Did he say anything? 'But little. 'Anything? Mary, confess He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me. 'Warren. 'But did he? I just want to know. 'Of course he did. What would you have him say? Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man Some humble way to save his self-respect. He added, if you really care to know, He meant to dear the upper pasture, too. That sounds like something you have heard before? Warren, I wish you could have heard the way He jumbled everything. I stopped to look Two or three times -- he made me feel so queer-- To see if he was talking in his sleep. He ran on Harold Wilson -- you remember - The boy you had in haying four years since. He's finished school, and teaching in his college. Silas declares you'll have to get him back. He says they two will make a team for work: Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! The way he mixed that in with other things. He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft On education -- you know how they fought All through July under the blazing sun, Silas up on the cart to build the load, Harold along beside to pitch it on. 'Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot. 'Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger! Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him. After so many years he still keeps finding Good arguments he sees he might have used. I sympathize. I know just how it feels To think of the right thing to say too late. Harold's associated in his mind with Latin. He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying He studied Latin like the violin Because he liked it -- that an argument! He said he couldn't make the boy believe He could find water with a hazel prong-- Which showed how much good school had ever done him. He wanted to go over that. But most of all He thinks if he could have another chance To teach him how to build a load of hay -- 'I know, that's Silas one accomplishment. He bundles every forkful in its place, And tags and numbers it for future reference, So he can find and easily dislodge it In the unloading. Silas does that well. He takes it out in bunches like big birds nests. You never see him standing on the hay He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself. 'He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be Some good perhaps to someone in the world. He hates to see a boy the fool of books. Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, And nothing to look backward to with pride, And nothing to look forward to with hope, So now and never any different. Part of a moon was filling down the west, Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, As if she played unheard the tenderness That wrought on him beside her in the night. Warren, she said, he has come home to die: You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time. 'Home, he mocked gently. Yes, what else but home? It all depends on what you mean by home. Of course he's nothing to us, any more then was the hound that came a stranger to us Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail. 'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in. 'I should have called it Something you somehow haven't to deserve. Warren leaned out and took a step or two, Picked up a little stick, and brought it back And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. Silas has better claim on us, you think, Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles As the road winds would bring him to his door. Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, A somebody- director in the bank. 'He never told us that. 'We know it though. 'I think his brother ought to help, of course. I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right To take him in, and might be willing to- He may be better than appearances. But have some pity on Silas. Do you think If he'd had any pride in claiming kin Or anything he looked for from his brother, He'd keep so still about him all this time? 'I wonder what's between them. 'I can tell you. Silas is what he is -- we wouldn't mind him-- But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. He never did a thing so very bad. He don't know why he isn't quite as good As anyone. He won't be made ashamed To please his brother, worthless though he is. 'I can't think Si ever hurt anyone. 'No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. You must go in and see what you can do. I made the bed up for him there to-night. You'll be surprised at him -- how much he's broken. His working days are done I'm sure of it. 'I'd not be in a hurry to say that. 'I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. But, Warren, please remember how it is: He come to help you ditch the meadow. He has a plan, You mustn't laugh at him. He may not speak of it, and then he may. I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud Will hit or miss the moon. It hit the moon.Then there were three there, making a dim row, The moon, the little silver cloud, and she. Warren returned-- too soon, it seemed to her, Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. Warren? she questioned. Dead, was all he answered.","source":"modern_poetry","id":713},{"title":"October","author":"Robert Frost","text":"O hushed October morning mild, Thy leaves have ripened to the fall Tomorrow's wind, if it be wild, Should waste them all.

I have two legs, and I move smilingly.. A sandy damper kills the vibrations It stretches for miles, the shrunk voices Waving and crutchless, half their old size. The lines of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces, Boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner. Is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses? Is it any wonder he affects a black cassock? Here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers Who wall up their backs against him. They are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts of a body. The sea, that crystallized these, Creeps away, many-snaked, with a long hiss of distress. This black boot has no mercy for anybody. Why should it, it is the hearse of a dad foot, The high, dead, toeless foot of this priest Who plumbs the well of his book, The bent print bulging before him like scenery. Obscene bikinis hid in the dunes, Breasts and hips a confectioner's sugar Of little crystals, titillating the light, While a green pool opens its eye, Sick with what it has swallowed---- Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the concrete bunkers Two lovers unstick themselves. O white sea-crockery, What cupped sighs, what salt in the throat.... And the onlooker, trembling, Drawn like a long material Through a still virulence, And a weed, hairy as privates. On the balconies of the hotel, things are glittering. Things, things---- Tubular steel wheelchairs, aluminum crutches. Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk Beyond the breakwater, spotty with barnacles?

There is no help in his weeping wife. Where are the eye-stones, yellow and vvaluable, And the tongue, sapphire of ash. A wedding-cake face in a paper frill. How superior he is now. It is like possessing a saint. The nurses in their wing-caps are no longer so beautiful They are browning, like touched gardenias. The bed is rolled from the wall. This is what it is to be complete. It is horrible. Is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit Under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak Rises so whitely unbuffeted? They propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened And folded his hands, that were shaking: goodbye, goodbye. Now the washed sheets fly in the sun, The pillow cases are sweetening. It is a blessing, it is a blessing: The long coffin of soap-colored oak, The curious bearers and the raw date Engraving itself in silver with marvelous calm. The gray sky lowers, the hills like a green sea Run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows, The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife---- Blunt, practical boats Full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters. In the parlor of the stone house One curtain is flickering from the open window, Flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle. This is the tongue of the dead man: remember, remember. How far he is now, his actions Around him like livingroom furniture, like a d�cor. As the pallors gather---- The pallors of hands and neighborly faces, The elate pallors of flying iris. They are flying off into nothing: remember us. The empty benches of memory look over stones, Marble facades with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils. It is so beautiful up here: it is a stopping place. The natural fatness of these lime leaves.---- Pollarded green balls, the trees march to church. The voice of the priest, in thin air, Meets the corpse at the gate, Addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell A glittler of wheat and crude earth. What is the name of that color?---- Old blood of caked walls the sun heals, Old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts. The widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters, Necessary among the flowers, Enfolds her lace like fine linen, Not to be spread again. While a sky, wormy with put-by smiles, Passes cloud after cloud. And the bride flowers expend a fershness, And the soul is a bride In a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless. Behind the glass of this car The world purrs, shut-off and gentle. And I am dark-suited and stil, a member of the party, Gliding up in low gear behind the cart. And the priest is a vessel, A tarred fabric,sorry and dull, Following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman, A crest of breasts, eyelids and lips Storming the hilltop. Then, from the barred yard, the children Smell the melt of shoe-blacking, Their faces turning, wordless and slow, Their eyes opening On a wonderful thing---- Six round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood, And a naked mouth, red and awkward.

Entranced by her presence, near and enigmatic, I gaze through the dark of her lowered veil And I behold an enchanted shoreline And enchanted distances, far and pale. I am made a guardian of the higher mysteries, Someone's sun is entrusted to my control. Tart wine has pierced the last convolution of my labyrinthine soul. And now the drooping plumes of ostriches Asway in my brain droop slowly lower And two eyes, limpid, blue, and fathomless Are blooming on a distant shore. Inside my soul a treasure is buried. The key is mine and only mine. How right you are, you drunken monster!

For his simple heart Might not resist the sacred influences Which from the stilly twilight of the place And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven Mingled their mossy boughs and from the sound Of the invisible breath that swayed at once All their green tops stole over him and bowed His spirit with the thought of boundless power And inaccessible majesty. Ah why Should we in the world's riper years neglect God's ancient sanctuaries and adore Only among the crowd and under roofs That our frail hands have raised?

Father thy hand Hath reared these venerable columns thou Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down Upon the naked earth and forthwith rose All these fair ranks of trees.

The water never formed to mind or voice, Like a body wholly body, fluttering Its empty sleeves and yet its mimic motion Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry, That was not ours although we understood, Inhuman, of the veritable ocean. The sea was not a mask. No more was she. The song and water were not medleyed sound Even if what she sang was what she heard. Since what she sang was uttered word by word. It may be that in all her phrases stirred The grinding water and the gasping wind But it was she and not the sea we heard. For she was the maker of the song she sang. The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea Was merely a place by which she walked to sing. Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew It was the spirit that we sought and knew That we should ask this often as she sang. If it was only the dark voice of the sea That rose, or even colored by many waves If it was only the outer voice of sky And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled, However clear, it would have been deep air, The heaving speech of air, a summer sound Repeated in a summer without end And sound alone. But it was more than that, More even than her voice, and ours, among The meaningless plungings of water and the wind, Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres Of sky and sea. It was her voice that made The sky acutest at its vanishing. She measured to the hour its solitude. She was the single artificer of the world In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea, Whatever self it had, became the self That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we, As we beheld her striding there alone, Knew that there never was a world for her Except the one she sang and, singing, made. Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know, Why, when the singing ended and we turned Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights, The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there, As night descended, tilting in the air, Mastered the night and portioned out the sea, Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles, Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.

She dreams a little, and she feels the dark Encroachment of that old catastrophe, As a calm darkens among water-lights. The pungent oranges and bright, green wings Seem things in some procession of the dead, Winding across wide water, without sound. The day is like wide water, without sound, Stilled for the passion of her dreaming feet Over the seas, to silent Palestine, Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. Why should she give her bounty to the dead? What is divinity if it can come Only in silent shadows and in dreams? Shall she not find in the comforts of sun, In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else In any balm or beauty of the earth, Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? Divinity must live within herself, Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued Elations when the forest blooms gusty Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights All pleasures and all pains, remembering The bough of summer and the winter branch. These are the measures destined for her soul. Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind He moved among us, as a muttering king, Magnificent, would move among his hinds, Until our blood, commingling, virginal, With heaven, brought such requital to desire The very hinds discerned it, in a star. Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be The blood of paradise? And shall the earth Seem all of paradise that we shall know? The sky will be much friendlier then than now, A part of labor and a part of pain, And next in glory to enduring love, Not this dividing and indifferent blue. She says, \"I am content when wakened birds, Before they fly, test the reality Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields Return no more, where, then, is paradise?\" There is not any haunt of prophecy, Nor any old chimera of the grave, Neither the golden underground, nor isle Melodious, where spirits gat them home, Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm Remote as heaven's hill, that has endured As April's green endures or will endure Like her rememberance of awakened birds, Or her desire for June and evening, tipped By the consummation of the swallow's wings. She says, \"But in contentment I still feel The need of some imperishable bliss.\" Death is the mother of beauty hence from her, Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams And our desires. Although she strews the leaves Of sure obliteration on our paths, The path sick sorrow took, the many paths Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love Whispered a little out of tenderness, She makes the willow shiver in the sun For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. She causes boys to pile new plums and pears On disregarded plate. The maidens taste And stray impassioned in the littering leaves. Is there no change of death in paradise? Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, With rivers like our own that seek for seas They never find, the same receeding shores That never touch with inarticulate pang? Why set the pear upon those river-banks Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? Alas, that they should wear our colors there, The silken weavings of our afternoons, And pick the strings of our insipid lutes. Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, Within whose burning bosom we devise Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. Supple and turbulent, a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun, Not as a god, but as a god might be, Naked among them, like a savage source. Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, Out of their blood, returning to the sky And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, The windy lake wherein their lord delights, The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, That choir among themselves long afterward. They shall know well the heavenly fellowship Of men that perish and of summer morn. And whence they came and whither they shall go The dew upon their feet shall manifest. She hears, upon that water without sound, A voice that cries, \"The tomb in Palestine Is not the porch of spirits lingering. It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\" We live in an old chaos of the sun, Or old dependency of day and night, Or island solitude, unsponsered, free, Of that wide water, inescapable. Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail Whistle about us their spontaneous cries Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness And, in the isolation of the sky, At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make Abiguous undulations as they sink, Downward to darkness, on extended wings.","source":"modern_poetry","id":768},{"title":"Six Significant Landscapes","author":"Wallace Stevens","text":"I An old man sits In the shadow of a pine tree In China.

Upon the bank, she stood In the cool Of spent emotions. She felt, among the leaves, The dew Of old devotions. She walked upon the grass, Still quavering.

As such, the Socrates Of snails, musician of pears, principium And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig Of things, this nincompated pedagogue, Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea Created, in his day, a touch of doubt. An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes, Berries of villages, a barber's eye, An eye of land, of simple salad-beds, Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung On porpoises, instead of apricots, And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts Dibbled in waves that were mustachios, Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world. One eats one pat��, even of salt, quotha. It was not so much the lost terrestrial, The snug hibernal from that sea and salt, That century of wind in a single puff.

What word split up in clickering syllables And storming under multitudinous tones Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt? Crispin was washed away by magnitude. The whole of life that still remained in him Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear, Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh, Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust.

A wordy, watery age That whispered to the sun's compassion, made A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars, And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that Which made him Triton, nothing left of him, Except in faint, memorial gesturings, That were like arms and shoulders in the waves, Here, something in the rise and fall of wind That seemed hallucinating horn, and here, A sunken voice, both of remembering And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.

The salt hung on his spirit like a frost, The dead brine melted in him like a dew Of winter, until nothing of himself Remained, except some starker, barer self In a starker, barer world, in which the sun Was not the sun because it never shone With bland complaisance on pale parasols, Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets. Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin Became an introspective voyager. Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last, Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing, But with a speech belched out of hoary darks Noway resembling his, a visible thing, And excepting negligible Triton, free From the unavoidable shadow of himself That lay elsewhere around him. Severance Was clear. The last distortion of romance Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea Severs not only lands but also selves. Here was no help before reality. Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new. The imagination, here, could not evade, In poems of plums, the strict austerity Of one vast, subjugating, final tone. The drenching of stale lives no more fell down. What was this gaudy, gusty panoply? Out of what swift destruction did it spring? It was caparison of mind and cloud And something given to make whole among The ruses that were shattered by the large. II Concerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers Of the Caribbean amphitheatre, In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea, As if raspberry tanagers in palms, High up in orange air, were barbarous. But Crispin was too destitute to find In any commonplace the sought-for aid. He was a man made vivid by the sea, A man come out of luminous traversing, Much trumpeted, made desperately clear, Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies, To whom oracular rockings gave no rest. Into a savage color he went on. How greatly had he grown in his demesne, This auditor of insects. He that saw The stride of vanishing autumn in a park By way of decorous melancholy he That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring, As dissertation of profound delight, Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes, Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged His apprehension, made him intricate In moody rucks, and difficult and strange In all desires, his destitution's mark. He was in this as other freemen are, Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly. His violence was for aggrandizement And not for stupor, such as music makes For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived That coolness for his heat came suddenly, And only, in the fables that he scrawled With his own quill, in its indigenous dew, Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed, Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt, Green barbarism turning paradigm. Crispin foresaw a curious promenade Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate, And elemental potencies and pangs, And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen, Making the most of savagery of palms, Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread. The fabulous and its intrinsic verse Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned In radiance from the Atlantic coign, For Crispin and his quill to catechize. But they came parlaying of such an earth, So thick with sides and jagged lops of green, So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns, Scenting the jungle in their refuges, So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins, That earth was like a jostling festival Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent, Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth. So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found A new reality in parrot-squawks. Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd Discoverer walked through the harbor streets Inspecting the cabildo, the fa?ade Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed, Approaching like a gasconade of drums. The white cabildo darkened, the fa?ade, As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up In swift, successive shadows, dolefully. The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind, Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry, Came bluntly thundering, more terrible Than the revenge of music on bassoons. Gesticulating lightning, mystical, Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight. An annotator has his scruples, too. He knelt in the cathedral with the rest, This connoisseur of elemental fate, Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one Of many proclamations of the kind, Proclaiming something harsher than he learned From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights Or seeing the midsummer artifice Of heat upon his pane. This was the span Of force, the quintessential fact, the note Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own, The thing that makes him envious in phrase. And while the torrent on the roof still droned He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free And more than free, elate, intent, profound And studious of a self possessing him, That was not in him in the crusty town From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades, In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap, Let down gigantic quavers of its voice, For Crispin to vociferate again. III Approaching Carolina The book of moonlight is not written yet Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire, Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage Through sweating changes, never could forget That wakefulness or meditating sleep, In which the sulky strophes willingly Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs. Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book For the legendary moonlight that once burned In Crispin's mind above a continent. America was always north to him, A northern west or western north, but north, And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled And lank, rising and slumping from a sea Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread In endless ledges, glittering, submerged And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon. The spring came there in clinking pannicles Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came, If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening, Before the winter's vacancy returned. The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed, Was like a glacial pink upon the air. The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians, Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn. How many poems he denied himself In his observant progress, lesser things Than the relentless contact he desired How many sea-masks he ignored what sounds He shut out from his tempering ear what thoughts, Like jades affecting the sequestered bride And what descants, he sent to banishment! Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave The liaison, the blissful liaison, Between himself and his environment, Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight, For him, and not for him alone. It seemed Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse, Wrong as a divagation to Peking, To him that postulated as his theme The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight, A passionately niggling nightingale. Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not, A minor meeting, facile, delicate. Thus he conceived his voyaging to be An up and down between two elements, A fluctuating between sun and moon, A sally into gold and crimson forms, As on this voyage, out of goblinry, And then retirement like a turning back And sinking down to the indulgences That in the moonlight have their habitude. But let these backward lapses, if they would, Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew It was a flourishing tropic he required For his refreshment, an abundant zone, Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious Yet with a harmony not rarefied Nor fined for the inhibited instruments Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed Between a Carolina of old time, A little juvenile, an ancient whim, And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn From what he saw across his vessel's prow. He came. The poetic hero without palms Or jugglery, without regalia. And as he came he saw that it was spring, A time abhorrent to the nihilist Or searcher for the fecund minimum. The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring, Although contending featly in its veils, Irised in dew and early fragrancies, Was gemmy marionette to him that sought A sinewy nakedness. A river bore The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose, He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells Of dampened lumber, emanations blown From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes, Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks That helped him round his rude aesthetic out. He savored rankness like a sensualist. He marked the marshy ground around the dock, The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence, Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore. It purified. It made him see how much Of what he saw he never saw at all. He gripped more closely the essential prose As being, in a world so falsified, The one integrity for him, the one Discovery still possible to make, To which all poems were incident, unless That prose should wear a poem's guise at last. IV The Idea of a Colony Nota: his soil is man's intelligence. That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find. Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare His cloudy drift and planned a colony. Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex, Rex and principium, exit the whole Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose More exquisite than any tumbling verse: A still new continent in which to dwell. What was the purpose of his pilgrimage, Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind, If not, when all is said, to drive away The shadow of his fellows from the skies, And, from their stale intelligence released, To make a new intelligence prevail? Hence the reverberations in the words Of his first central hymns, the celebrants Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength Of his aesthetic, his philosophy, The more invidious, the more desired. The florist asking aid from cabbages, The rich man going bare, the paladin Afraid, the blind man as astronomer, The appointed power unwielded from disdain. His western voyage ended and began. The torment of fastidious thought grew slack, Another, still more bellicose, came on. He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena, And, being full of the caprice, inscribed Commingled souvenirs and prophecies. He made a singular collation. Thus: The natives of the rain are rainy men. Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes, And April hillsides wooded white and pink, Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears. And in their music showering sounds intone. On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote, What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore, What pulpy dram distilled of innocence, That streaking gold should speak in him Or bask within his images and words? If these rude instances impeach themselves By force of rudeness, let the principle Be plain. For application Crispin strove, Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute As the marimba, the magnolia as rose. Upon these premises propounding, he Projected a colony that should extend To the dusk of a whistling south below the south. A comprehensive island hemisphere. The man in Georgia waking among pines Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man, Planting his pristine cores in Florida, Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery, But on the banjo's categorical gut, Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays. Sepulchral se?ors, bibbing pale mescal, Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs, Should make the intricate Sierra scan. And dark Brazilians in their caf��s, Musing immaculate, pampean dits, Should scrawl a vigilant anthology, To be their latest, lucent paramour. These are the broadest instances. Crispin, Progenitor of such extensive scope, Was not indifferent to smart detail. The melon should have apposite ritual, Performed in verd apparel, and the peach, When its black branches came to bud, belle day, Should have an incantation. And again, When piled on salvers its aroma steeped The summer, it should have a sacrament And celebration. Shrewd novitiates Should be the clerks of our experience. These bland excursions into time to come, Related in romance to backward flights, However prodigal, however proud, Contained in their afflatus the reproach That first drove Crispin to his wandering. He could not be content with counterfeit, With masquerade of thought, with hapless words That must belie the racking masquerade, With fictive flourishes that preordained His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly. It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was, Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event, A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown. There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not The oncoming fantasies of better birth. The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way. All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged. But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim. Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets, With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener? No, no: veracious page on page, exact. V A Nice Shady Home Crispin as hermit, pure and capable, Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent Had kept him still the pricking realist, Choosing his element from droll confect Of was and is and shall or ought to be, Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come To colonize his polar planterdom And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee. But his emprize to that idea soon sped. Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there Slid from his continent by slow recess To things within his actual eye, alert To the difficulty of rebellious thought When the sky is blue. The blue infected will. It may be that the yarrow in his fields Sealed pensive purple under its concern. But day by day, now this thing and now that Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned, Little by little, as if the suzerain soil Abashed him by carouse to humble yet Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement. He first, as realist, admitted that Whoever hunts a matinal continent May, after all, stop short before a plum And be content and still be realist. The words of things entangle and confuse. The plum survives its poems. It may hang In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground Obliquities of those who pass beneath, Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form, Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit. So Crispin hasped on the surviving form, For him, of shall or ought to be in is. Was he to bray this in profoundest brass Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems? Was he to company vastest things defunct With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky? Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong His active force in an inactive dirge, Which, let the tall musicians call and call, Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds? Because he built a cabin who once planned Loquacious columns by the ructive sea? Because he turned to salad-beds again? Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape? Should he lay by the personal and make Of his own fate an instance of all fate? What is one man among so many men? What are so many men in such a world? Can one man think one thing and think it long? Can one man be one thing and be it long? The very man despising honest quilts Lies quilted to his poll in his despite. For realists, what is is what should be. And so it came, his cabin shuffled up, His trees were planted, his duenna brought Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands, The curtains flittered and the door was closed. Crispin, magister of a single room, Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down It was as if the solitude concealed And covered him and his congenial sleep. So deep a sound fell down it grew to be A long soothsaying silence down and down. The crickets beat their tambours in the wind, Marching a motionless march, custodians. In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod, Each day, still curious, but in a round Less prickly and much more condign than that He once thought necessary. Like Candide, Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight, And cream for the fig and silver for the cream, A blonde to tip the silver and to taste The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries! Yet the quotidian saps philosophers And men like Crispin like them in intent, If not in will, to track the knaves of thought. But the quotidian composed as his, Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves, The tomtit and the cassia and the rose, Although the rose was not the noble thorn Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet, Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights In which those frail custodians watched, Indifferent to the tepid summer cold, While he poured out upon the lips of her That lay beside him, the quotidian Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner. For all it takes it gives a humped return Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed. VI And Daughters with Curls Portentous enunciation, syllable To blessed syllable affined, and sound Bubbling felicity in cantilene, Prolific and tormenting tenderness Of music, as it comes to unison, Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur His grand pronunciamento and devise. The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed, Hands without touch yet touching poignantly, Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee, Prophetic joint, for its diviner young. The return to social nature, once begun, Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute, Involved him in midwifery so dense His cabin counted as phylactery, Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt Of children nibbling at the sugared void, Infants yet eminently old, then dome And halidom for the unbraided femes, Green crammers of the green fruits of the world, Bidders and biders for its ecstasies, True daughters both of Crispin and his clay. All this with many mulctings of the man, Effective colonizer sharply stopped In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom. But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex The stopper to indulgent fatalist Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant, She seemed, of a country of the capuchins, So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed, Attentive to a coronal of things Secret and singular. Second, upon A second similar counterpart, a maid Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake Excepting to the motherly footstep, but Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep. Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light, A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth, Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified, All din and gobble, blasphemously pink. A few years more and the vermeil capuchin Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was, The dulcet omen fit for such a house. The second sister dallying was shy To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself Out of her botches, hot embosomer. The third one gaping at the orioles Lettered herself demurely as became A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody. The fourth, pent now, a digit curious. Four daughters in a world too intricate In the beginning, four blithe instruments Of differing struts, four voices several In couch, four more person?, intimate As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue That should be silver, four accustomed seeds Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights That spread chromatics in hilarious dark, Four questioners and four sure answerers. Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout. The world, a turnip once so readily plucked, Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main, And sown again by the stiffest realist, Came reproduced in purple, family font, The same insoluble lump. The fatalist Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw, Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote Invented for its pith, not doctrinal In form though in design, as Crispin willed, Disguised pronunciamento, summary, Autumn's compendium, strident in itself But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved In those portentous accents, syllables, And sounds of music coming to accord Upon his law, like their inherent sphere, Seraphic proclamations of the pure Delivered with a deluging onwardness. Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote Is false, if Crispin is a profitless Philosopher, beginning with green brag, Concluding fadedly, if as a man Prone to distemper he abates in taste, Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure, Glozing his life with after-shining flicks, Illuminating, from a fancy gorged By apparition, plain and common things, Sequestering the fluster from the year, Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops, And so distorting, proving what he proves Is nothing, what can all this matter since The relation comes, benignly, to its end? So may the relation of each man be clipped.","source":"modern_poetry","id":778},{"title":"To You.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"STRANGER. if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak to me, why should you not speak to me?

I am satisfied��I see, dance, laugh, sing: As the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day, with stealthy tread, Leaving me baskets cover��d with white towels, swelling the house with their plenty, Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, and scream at my eyes, That they turn from gazing after and down the road, And forthwith cipher and show me a cent, Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and which is ahead? Trippers and askers surround me People I meet��the effect upon me of my early life, or the ward and city I live in, or the nation, The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new, My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues, The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love, The sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or ill-doing, or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events These come to me days and nights, and go from me again, But they are not the Me myself. Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest, Looking with side-curved head, curious what will come next Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering at it. Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders I have no mockings or arguments��I witness and wait. I believe in you, my Soul��the other I am must not abase itself to you And you must not be abased to the other. Loafe with me on the grass��loose the stop from your throat Not words, not music or rhyme I want��not custom or lecture, not even the best Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice. I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning How you settled your head athwart my hips, and gently turn��d over upon me, And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, And reach��d till you felt my beard, and reach��d till you held my feet. Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own, And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers And that a kelson of the creation is love And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields And brown ants in the little wells beneath them And mossy scabs of the worm fence, and heap��d stones, elder, mullen and poke-weed. A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is, any more than he. I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven. Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropt, Bearing the owner��s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say, Whose? Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation. Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, Growing among black folks as among white Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same. And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves. Tenderly will I use you, curling grass It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men It may be if I had known them I would have loved them It may be you are from old people, and from women, and from offspring taken soon out of their mothers�� laps And here you are the mothers�� laps. This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers Darker than the colorless beards of old men Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths. O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues. And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing. I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women, And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps. What do you think has become of the young and old men? And what do you think has become of the women and children? They are alive and well somewhere The smallest sprout shows there is really no death And if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it, And ceas��d the moment life appear��d. All goes onward and outward��nothing collapses And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier. Has any one supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it. I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-wash��d babe, and am not contain��d between my hat and boots And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good The earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good. I am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself They do not know how immortal, but I know. Every kind for itself and its own��for me mine, male and female For me those that have been boys, and that love women For me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings to be slighted For me the sweet-heart and the old maid��for me mothers, and the mothers of mothers For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears For me children, and the begetters of children. Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away. The little one sleeps in its cradle I lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand. The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill I peeringly view them from the top. The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-room I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair��I note where the pistol has fallen. The blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor The snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous��d mobs The flap of the curtain��d litter, a sick man inside, borne to the hospital The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall The excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes What groans of over-fed or half-starv��d who fall sun-struck, or in fits What exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to babes What living and buried speech is always vibrating here��what howls restrain��d by decorum Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips I mind them or the show or resonance of them��I come, and I depart. The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged The armfuls are pack��d to the sagging mow. I am there��I help��I came stretch��d atop of the load I felt its soft jolts��one leg reclined on the other I jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and timothy, And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps. Alone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt, Wandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night, Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill��d game Falling asleep on the gather��d leaves, with my dog and gun by my side. The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails��she cuts the sparkle and scud My eyes settle the land��I bend at her prow, or shout joyously from the deck. The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me I tuck��d my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and had a good time: You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle. I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west��the bride was a red girl Her father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly smoking��they had moccasins to their feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders On a bank lounged the trapper��he was drest mostly in skins��his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck��he held his bride by the hand She had long eyelashes��her head was bare��her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach��d to her feet. The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak, And went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him, And brought water, and fill��d a tub for his sweated body and bruis��d feet, And gave him a room that enter��d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes, And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness, And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass��d north I had him sit next me at table��my fire-lock lean��d in the corner. Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly: Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome. She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window. Which of the young men does she like the best? Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her. Where are you off to, lady? for I see you You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room. Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them. The beards of the young men glisten��d with wet, it ran from their long hair: Little streams pass��d all over their bodies. An unseen hand also pass��d over their bodies It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs. The young men float on their backs��their white bellies bulge to the sun��they do not ask who seizes fast to them They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch They do not think whom they souse with spray. The butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market I loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and break-down. Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil Each has his main-sledge��they are all out��there is a great heat in the fire. From the cinder-strew��d threshold I follow their movements The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms Over-hand the hammers swing��over-hand so slow��over-hand so sure: They do not hasten��each man hits in his place. The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses��the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain The negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard��steady and tall he stands, pois��d on one leg on the string-piece His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and loosens over his hip-band His glance is calm and commanding��he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache��falls on the black of his polish��d and perfect limbs. I behold the picturesque giant, and love him��and I do not stop there I go with the team also. In me the caresser of life wherever moving��backward as well as forward slueing To niches aside and junior bending. Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! what is that you express in your eyes? It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life. My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on my distant and day-long ramble They rise together��they slowly circle around. I believe in those wing��d purposes, And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me, And consider green and violet, and the tufted crown, intentional And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me. The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky. The sharp-hoof��d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog, The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats, The brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-spread wings I see in them and myself the same old law. The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections They scorn the best I can do to relate them. I am enamour��d of growing out-doors, Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods, Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out. What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me Not asking the sky to come down to my good will Scattering it freely forever. The pure contralto sings in the organ loft The carpenter dresses his plank��the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner The pilot seizes the king-pin��he heaves down with a strong arm The mate stands braced in the whale-boat��lance and harpoon are ready The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches The deacons are ordain��d with cross��d hands at the altar The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel The farmer stops by the bars, as he walks on a First-day loafe, and looks at the oats and rye The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum, a confirm��d case, He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother��s bed-room The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case, He turns his quid of tobacco, while his eyes blurr with the manuscript The malform��d limbs are tied to the surgeon��s table, What is removed drops horribly in a pail The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand��the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove The machinist rolls up his sleeves��the policeman travels his beat��the gate-keeper marks who pass The young fellow drives the express-wagon��I love him, though I do not know him The half-breed straps on his light boots to complete in the race The western turkey-shooting draws old and young��some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs, Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof��d garret, and harks to the musical rain The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm��d cloth, is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat, the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers The young sister holds out the skein, while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots The one-year wife is recovering and happy, having a week ago borne her first child The clean-hair��d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine, or in the factory or mill The nine months�� gone is in the parturition chamber, her faintness and pains are advancing The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer��the reporter��s lead flies swiftly over the note-book��the sign-painter is lettering with red and gold The canal boy trots on the tow-path��the book-keeper counts at his desk��the shoemaker waxes his thread The conductor beats time for the band, and all the performers follow him The child is baptized��the convert is making his first professions The regatta is spread on the bay��the race is begun��how the white sails sparkle! The drover, watching his drove, sings out to them that would stray The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, the purchaser higgling about the odd cent The camera and plate are prepared, the lady must sit for her daguerreotype The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open��d lips The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths, nor jeer you The President, holding a cabinet council, is surrounded by the Great Secretaries On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold The Missourian crosses the plains, toting his wares and his cattle As the fare-collector goes through the train, he gives notice by the jingling of loose change The floor-men are laying the floor��the tinners are tinning the roof��the masons are calling for mortar In single file, each shouldering his hod, pass onward the laborers Seasons pursuing each other, the indescribable crowd is gather��d��it is the Fourth of Seventh-month��What salutes of cannon and small arms! Seasons pursuing each other, the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe Flatboatmen make fast, towards dusk, near the cottonwood or pekan-trees Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river, or through those drain��d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansaw Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahoochee or Altamahaw Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day��s sport The city sleeps, and the country sleeps The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps by his wife And these one and all tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them And such as it is to be of these, more or less, I am. I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise Regardless of others, ever regardful of others, Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man, Stuff��d with the stuff that is coarse, and stuff��d with the stuff that is fine One of the Great Nation, the nation of many nations, the smallest the same, and the largest the same A southerner soon as a northerner��a planter nonchalant and hospitable, down by the Oconee I live A Yankee, bound by my own way, ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth, and the sternest joints on earth A Kentuckian, walking the vale of the Elkhorn, in my deer-skin leggings��a Louisianian or Georgian A boatman over lakes or bays, or along coasts��a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye At home on Kanadian snow-shoes, or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking At home on the hills of Vermont, or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch Comrade of Californians��comrade of free north-westerners, loving their big proportions Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen��comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest A novice beginning, yet experient of myriads of seasons Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker A prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest. I resist anything better than my own diversity I breathe the air, but leave plenty after me, And am not stuck up, and am in my place. The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place The suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, are in their place The palpable is in its place, and the impalpable is in its place. These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands��they are not original with me If they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing If they are not the riddle, and the untying of the riddle, they are nothing If they are not just as close as they are distant, they are nothing. This is the grass that grows wherever the land is, and the water is This is the common air that bathes the globe. With music strong I come��with my cornets and my drums, I play not marches for accepted victors only��I play great marches for conquer��d and slain persons. Have you heard that it was good to gain the day? I also say it is good to fall��battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won. I beat and pound for the dead I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them. Vivas to those who have fail��d! And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea! And to those themselves who sank in the sea! And to all generals that lost engagements! and all overcome heroes! And the numberless unknown heroes, equal to the greatest heroes known. This is the meal equally set��this is the meat for natural hunger It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous��I make appointments with all I will not have a single person slighted or left away The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited The heavy-lipp��d slave is invited��the venerealee is invited: There shall be no difference between them and the rest. This is the press of a bashful hand��this is the float and odor of hair This is the touch of my lips to yours��this is the murmur of yearning This is the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face This is the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again. Do you guess I have some intricate purpose? Well, I have��for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has. Do you take it I would astonish? Does the daylight astonish? Does the early redstart, twittering through the woods? Do I astonish more than they? This hour I tell things in confidence I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you. Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat? What is a man, anyhow? What am I? What are you? All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own Else it were time lost listening to me. I do not snivel that snivel the world over, That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare crape, and tears. Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids��conformity goes to the fourth-remov��d I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out. Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be ceremonious? Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsell��d with doctors, and calculated close, I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones. In all people I see myself��none more, and not one a barleycorn less And the good or bad I say of myself, I say of them. And I know I am solid and sound To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means. I know I am deathless I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter��s compass I know I shall not pass like a child��s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night. I know I am august I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood I see that the elementary laws never apologize I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all. I exist as I am��that is enough If no other in the world be aware, I sit content And if each and all be aware, I sit content. One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million years, I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait. My foothold is tenon��d and mortis��d in granite I laugh at what you call dissolution And I know the amplitude of time. I am the poet of the Body And I am the poet of the Soul. The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with me The first I graft and increase upon myself��the latter I translate into a new tongue. I am the poet of the woman the same as the man And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men. I chant the chant of dilation or pride We have had ducking and deprecating about enough I show that size is only development. Have you outstript the rest? Are you the President? It is a trifle��they will more than arrive there, every one, and still pass on. I am he that walks with the tender and growing night I call to the earth and sea, half-held by the night. Press close, bare-bosom��d night! Press close, magnetic, nourishing night! Night of south winds! night of the large few stars! Still, nodding night! mad, naked, summer night. Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breath��d earth! Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees Earth of departed sunset! earth of the mountains, misty-topt! Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with blue! Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river! Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clearer for my sake! Far-swooping elbow��d earth! rich, apple-blossom��d earth! Smile, for your lover comes! Prodigal, you have given me love! Therefore I to you give love! O unspeakable, passionate love! You sea! I resign myself to you also��I guess what you mean I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me We must have a turn together��I undress��hurry me out of sight of the land Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse Dash me with amorous wet��I can repay you. Sea of stretch��d ground-swells! Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths! Sea of the brine of life! sea of unshovell��d yet always-ready graves! Howler and scooper of storms! capricious and dainty sea! I am integral with you��I too am of one phase, and of all phases. Partaker of influx and efflux I��extoller of hate and conciliation Extoller of amies, and those that sleep in each others�� arms. I am he attesting sympathy Shall I make my list of things in the house, and skip the house that supports them? I am not the poet of goodness only��I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also. Washes and razors for foofoos��for me freckles and a bristling beard. What blurt is this about virtue and about vice? Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels me��I stand indifferent My gait is no fault-finder��s or rejecter��s gait I moisten the roots of all that has grown. Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy? Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work��d over and rectified? I find one side a balance, and the antipodal side a balance Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine Thoughts and deeds of the present, our rouse and early start. This minute that comes to me over the past decillions, There is no better than it and now. What behaved well in the past, or behaves well to-day, is not such a wonder The wonder is, always and always, how there can be a mean man or an infidel. Endless unfolding of words of ages! And mine a word of the modern��the word En-Masse. A word of the faith that never balks Here or henceforward, it is all the same to me��I accept Time, absolutely. It alone is without flaw��it rounds and completes all That mystic, baffling wonder I love, alone completes all. I accept reality, and dare not question it Materialism first and last imbuing. Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration! Fetch stonecrop, mixt with cedar and branches of lilac This is the lexicographer��this the chemist��this made a grammar of the old cartouches These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas This is the geologist��this works with the scalpel��and this is a mathematician. Gentlemen! to you the first honors always: Your facts are useful and real��and yet they are not my dwelling I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling. Less the reminders of properties told, my words And more the reminders, they, of life untold, and of freedom and extrication, And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt, And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives, and them that plot and conspire. Walt Whitman am I, a Kosmos, of mighty Manhattan the son, Turbulent, fleshy and sensual, eating, drinking and breeding No sentimentalist��no stander above men and women, or apart from them No more modest than immodest. Unscrew the locks from the doors! Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs! Whoever degrades another degrades me And whatever is done or said returns at last to me. Through me the afflatus surging and surging��through me the current and index. I speak the pass-word primeval��I give the sign of democracy By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms. Through me many long dumb voices Voices of the interminable generations of slaves Voices of prostitutes, and of deform��d persons Voices of the diseas��d and despairing, and of thieves and dwarfs Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, And of the threads that connect the stars��and of wombs, and of the father-stuff, And of the rights of them the others are down upon Of the trivial, flat, foolish, despised, Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung. Through me forbidden voices Voice of sexes and lusts��voices veil��d, and I remove the veil Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigur��d. I do not press my fingers across my mouth I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart Copulation is no more rank to me than death is. I believe in the flesh and the appetites Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle. Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch��d from The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds. If I worship one thing more than another, it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it. Translucent mould of me, it shall be you! Shaded ledges and rests, it shall be you! Firm masculine colter, it shall be you. Whatever goes to the tilth of me, it shall be you! You my rich blood! Your milky stream, pale strippings of my life. Breast that presses against other breasts, it shall be you! My brain, it shall be your occult convolutions. Root of wash��d sweet flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you! Mix��d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you! Trickling sap of maple! fibre of manly wheat! it shall be you! Sun so generous, it shall be you! Vapors lighting and shading my face, it shall be you! You sweaty brooks and dews, it shall be you! Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me, it shall be you! Broad, muscular fields! branches of live oak! loving lounger in my winding paths! it shall be you! Hands I have taken��face I have kiss��d��mortal I have ever touch��d! it shall be you. I dote on myself��there is that lot of me, and all so luscious Each moment, and whatever happens, thrills me with joy. O I am wonderful! I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again. That I walk up my stoop! I pause to consider if it really be A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books. To behold the day-break! The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows The air tastes good to my palate. Hefts of the moving world, at innocent gambols, silently rising, freshly exuding, Scooting obliquely high and low. Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven. The earth by the sky staid with��the daily close of their junction The heav��d challenge from the east that moment over my head The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master! Dazzling and tremendous, how quick the sun-rise would kill me, If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me. We also ascend, dazzling and tremendous as the sun We found our own, O my Soul, in the calm and cool of the daybreak. My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds, and volumes of worlds. Speech is the twin of my vision��it is unequal to measure itself It provokes me forever It says sarcastically, Walt, you contain enough��why don��t you let it out, then? Come now, I will not be tantalized��you conceive too much of articulation. Do you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded? Waiting in gloom, protected by frost The dirt receding before my prophetical screams I underlying causes, to balance them at last My knowledge my live parts��it keeping tally with the meaning of things, HAPPINESS��which, whoever hears me, let him or her set out in search of this day. My final merit I refuse you��I refuse putting from me what I really am Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you. Writing and talk do not prove me I carry the plenum of proof, and everything else, in my face With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic. I think I will do nothing now but listen, To accrue what I hear into myself��to let sounds contribute toward me. I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following Sounds of the city, and sounds out of the city��sounds of the day and night Talkative young ones to those that like them��the loud laugh of work-people at their meals The angry base of disjointed friendship��the faint tones of the sick The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence The heave��e��yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves��the refrain of the anchor-lifters The ring of alarm-bells��the cry of fire��the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts, with premonitory tinkles, and color��d lights The steam-whistle��the solid roll of the train of approaching cars The slow-march play��d at the head of the association, marching two and two, They go to guard some corpse��the flag-tops are draped with black muslin. I hear the violoncello ��tis the young man��s heart��s complaint I hear the key��d cornet��it glides quickly in through my ears It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast. I hear the chorus��it is a grand opera Ah, this indeed is music! This suits me. A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full. I hear the train��d soprano��what work, with hers, is this? The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies It wrenches such ardors from me, I did not know I possess��d them It sails me��I dab with bare feet��they are lick��d by the indolent waves I am exposed, cut by bitter and angry hail��I lose my breath, Steep��d amid honey��d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles, And that we call BEING. To be, in any form��what is that? Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither If nothing lay more develop��d, the quahaug in its callous shell were enough. Mine is no callous shell I have instant conductors all over me, whether I pass or stop They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me. I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy To touch my person to some one else��s is about as much as I can stand. Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity, Flames and ether making a rush for my veins, Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them, My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs, Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip, Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, Depriving me of my best, as for a purpose, Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist, Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields, Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, They bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze at the edges of me No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while, Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me. The sentries desert every other part of me They have left me helpless to a red marauder They all come to the headland, to witness and assist against me. I am given up by traitors I talk wildly��I have lost my wits��I and nobody else am the greatest traitor I went myself first to the headland��my own hands carried me there. You villian touch! what are you doing? My breath is tight in its throat Unclench your floodgates! you are too much for me. Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath��d, hooded, sharp-tooth��d touch! Did it make you ache so, leaving me? Parting, track��d by arriving��perpetual payment of perpetual loan Rich, showering rain, and recompense richer afterward. Sprouts take and accumulate��stand by the curb prolific and vital: Landscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized and golden. All truths wait in all things They neither hasten their own delivery, nor resist it They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon The insignificant is as big to me as any What is less or more than a touch? Logic and sermons never convince The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul. Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so Only what nobody denies is so. A minute and a drop of me settle my brain I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps, And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman, And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other, And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific, And until every one shall delight us, and we them. I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars, And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, And the tree-toad is a chef-d��oeuvre for the highest, And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery, And the cow crunching with depress��d head surpasses any statue, And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels, And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer��s girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking shortcake. I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, And am stucco��d with quadrupeds and birds all over, And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons, And call anything close again, when I desire it. In vain the speeding or shyness In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder��d bones In vain objects stand leagues off, and assume manifold shapes In vain the ocean settling in hollows, and the great monsters lying low In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods In vain the razor-bill��d auk sails far north to Labrador I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff. I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain��d I stand and look at them long and long. They do not sweat and whine about their condition They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God Not one is dissatisfied��not one is demented with the mania of owning things Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth. So they show their relations to me, and I accept them They bring me tokens of myself��they evince them plainly in their possession. I wonder where they get those tokens: Did I pass that way huge times ago, and negligently drop them? Myself moving forward then and now and forever, Gathering and showing more always and with velocity, Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms. A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses, Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears, Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground, Eyes full of sparkling wickedness��ears finely cut, flexibly moving. His nostrils dilate, as my heels embrace him His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, as we race around and return. I but use you a moment, then I resign you, stallion Why do I need your paces, when I myself out-gallop them? Even, as I stand or sit, passing faster than you. O swift wind! O space and time! now I see it is true, what I guessed at What I guess��d when I loaf��d on the grass What I guess��d while I lay alone in my bed, And again as I walk��d the beach under the paling stars of the morning. My ties and ballasts leave me��I travel��I sail��my elbows rest in the sea-gaps I skirt the sierras��my palms cover continents I am afoot with my vision. By the city��s quadrangular houses��in log huts��camping with lumbermen Along the ruts of the turnpike��along the dry gulch and rivulet bed Weeding my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips��crossing savannas��trailing in forests Prospecting��gold-digging��girdling the trees of a new purchase Scorch��d ankle-deep by the hot sand��hauling my boat down the shallow river Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead��where the buck turns furiously at the hunter Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock��where the otter is feeding on fish Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey��where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail Over the growing sugar��over the yellow-flower��d cotton plant��over the rice in its low moist field Over the sharp-peak��d farm house, with its scallop��d scum and slender shoots from the gutters Over the western persimmon��over the long-leav��d corn��over the delicate blue-flower flax Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs Walking the path worn in the grass, and beat through the leaves of the brush Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve��where the great gold-bug drops through the dark Where flails keep time on the barn floor Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen��where andirons straddle the hearth-slab��where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters Where trip-hammers crash��where the press is whirling its cylinders Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, floating in it myself, and looking composedly down Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose��where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand Where the she-whale swims with her calf, and never forsakes it Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water Where the half-burn��d brig is riding on unknown currents, Where shells grow to her slimy deck��where the dead are corrupting below Where the dense-starr��d flag is borne at the head of the regiments Approaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching island Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance Upon a door-step��upon the horse-block of hard wood outside Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a good game of base-ball At he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter At the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw At apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings: Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard��where the dry-stalks are scattered��where the brood-cow waits in the hovel Where the bull advances to do his masculine work��where the stud to the mare��where the cock is treading the hen Where the heifers browse��where geese nip their food with short jerks Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near Where the humming-bird shimmers��where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden, half hid by the high weeds Where band-neck��d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out Where burial coaches enter the arch��d gates of a cemetery Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees Where the yellow-crown��d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs Through the gymnasium��through the curtain��d saloon��through the office or public hall Pleas��d with the native, and pleas��d with the foreign��pleas��d with the new and old Pleas��d with women, the homely as well as the handsome Pleas��d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously Pleas��d with the tune of the choir of the white-wash��d church Pleas��d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, or any preacher��impress��d seriously at the camp-meeting: Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon��flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate-glass Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn��d up to the clouds, My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle: Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek��d bush-boy��behind me he rides at the drape of the day Far from the settlements, studying the print of animals�� feet, or the moccasin print By the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade to a feverish patient Nigh the coffin��d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle: Voyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while Walking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful gentle God by my side Speeding through space��speeding through heaven and the stars Speeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles Speeding with tail��d meteors��throwing fire-balls like the rest Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing I tread day and night such roads. I visit the orchards of spheres, and look at the product: And look at quintillions ripen��d, and look at quintillions green. I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul My course runs below the soundings of plummets. I help myself to material and immaterial No guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me. I anchor my ship for a little while only My messengers continually cruise away, or bring their returns to me. I go hunting polar furs and the seal��leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff��clinging to topples of brittle and blue. I ascend to the foretruck I take my place late at night in the crow��s-nest We sail the arctic sea��it is plenty light enough Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty The enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them��the scenery is plain in all directions The white-topt mountains show in the distance��I fling out my fancies toward them We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment��we pass with still feet and caution Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin��d city The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe. I am a free companion��I bivouac by invading watchfires. I turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the bride myself I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips. My voice is the wife��s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs They fetch my man��s body up, dripping and drown��d. I understand the large hearts of heroes, The courage of present times and all times How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights, And chalk��d in large letters, on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you: How he follow��d with them, and tack��d with them��and would not give it up How he saved the drifting company at last: How the lank loose-gown��d women look��d when boated from the side of their prepared graves How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp��d unshaved men: All this I swallow��it tastes good��I like it well��it becomes mine I am the man��I suffer��d��I was there. The disdain and calmness of olden martyrs The mother, condemn��d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover��d with sweat The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck��the murderous buckshot and the bullets All these I feel, or am. I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs, Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn��d with the ooze of my skin I fall on the weeds and stones The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, Taunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks. Agonies are one of my changes of garments I do not ask the wounded person how he feels��I myself become the wounded person My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe. I am the mash��d fireman with breast-bone broken Tumbling walls buried me in their debris Heat and smoke I inspired��I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels They have clear��d the beams away��they tenderly lift me forth. I lie in the night air in my red shirt��the pervading hush is for my sake Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy White and beautiful are the faces around me��the heads are bared of their fire-caps The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches. Distant and dead resuscitate They show as the dial or move as the hands of me��I am the clock myself. I am an old artillerist��I tell of my fort��s bombardment I am there again. Again the long roll of the drummers Again the attacking cannon, mortars Again, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive. I take part��I see and hear the whole The cries, curses, roar��the plaudits for well-aim��d shots The ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs The fall of grenades through the rent roof��the fan-shaped explosion The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air. Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general��he furiously waves with his hand He gasps through the clot, Mind not me��mind��the entrenchments. Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth I tell not the fall of Alamo, Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo, The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo ��Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men. Retreating, they had form��d in a hollow square, with their baggage for breastworks Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy��s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv��d writing and seal, gave up their arms, and march��d back prisoners of war. They were the glory of the race of rangers Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship, Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate, Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters, Not a single one over thirty years of age. The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads, and massacred��it was beautiful early summer The work commenced about five o��clock, and was over by eight. None obey��d the command to kneel Some made a mad and helpless rush��some stood stark and straight A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart��the living and dead lay together The maim��d and mangled dug in the dirt��the newcomers saw them there Some, half-kill��d, attempted to crawl away These were despatch��d with bayonets, or batter��d with the blunts of muskets A youth not seventeen years old seiz��d his assassin till two more came to release him The three were all torn, and cover��d with the boy��s blood. At eleven o��clock began the burning of the bodies: That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men. Would you hear of an old-fashion��d sea-fight? Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? List to the story as my grandmother��s father, the sailor, told it to me. Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, said he His was the surly English pluck��and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be Along the lower��d eve he came, horribly raking us. We closed with him��the yards entangled��the cannon touch��d My captain lash��d fast with his own hands. We had receiv��d some eighteen pound shots under the water On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up overhead. Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark Ten o��clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold, to give them a chance for themselves. The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, They see so many strange faces, they do not know whom to trust. Our frigate takes fire The other asks if we demand quarter? If our colors are struck, and the fighting is done? Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain, We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting. Only three guns are in use One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy��s mainmast Two, well served with grape and canister, silence his musketry and clear his decks. The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top They hold out bravely during the whole of the action. Not a moment��s cease The leaks gain fast on the pumps��the fire eats toward the powder-magazine. One of the pumps has been shot away��it is generally thought we are sinking. Serene stands the little captain He is not hurried��his voice is neither high nor low His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns. Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they surrender to us. Stretch��d and still lies the midnight Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking��preparations to pass to the one we have conquer��d The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet Near by, the corpse of the child that serv��d in the cabin The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl��d whiskers The flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering aloft and below The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves��dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars, Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves, Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent, Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors, The hiss of the surgeon��s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw, Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan These so��these irretrievable. O Christ! This is mastering me! In at the conquer��d doors they crowd. I am possess��d. I embody all presences outlaw��d or suffering See myself in prison shaped like another man, And feel the dull unintermitted pain. For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch It is I let out in the morning, and barr��d at night. Not a mutineer walks handcuff��d to jail, but I am handcuff��d to him and walk by his side I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one, with sweat on my twitching lips. Not a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced. Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp, but I also lie at the last gasp My face is ash-color��d��my sinews gnarl��away from me people retreat. Askers embody themselves in me, and I am embodied in them I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg. Enough! enough! enough! Somehow I have been stunn��d. Stand back! Give me a little time beyond my cuff��d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake. That I could forget the mockers and insults! That I could forget the trickling tears, and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers! That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning. I remember now I resume the overstaid fraction The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me. I troop forth replenish��d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession Inland and sea-coast we go, and we pass all boundary lines Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years. Eleves, I salute you! come forward! Continue your annotations, continue your questionings. The friendly and flowing savage, Who is he? Is he waiting for civilization, or past it, and mastering it? Is he some south-westerner, rais��d out-doors? Is he Kanadian? Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California? the mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or from the sea? Wherever he goes, men and women accept and desire him They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them. Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb��d head, laughter, and naivet��, Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath��they fly out of the glance of his eyes. Flaunt of the sunshine, I need not your bask,��lie over! You light surfaces only��I force surfaces and depths also. Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands Say, old Top-knot! what do you want? Man or woman! I might tell how I like you, but cannot And might tell what it is in me, and what it is in you, but cannot And might tell that pining I have��that pulse of my nights and days. Behold! I do not give lectures, or a little charity When I give, I give myself. You there, impotent, loose in the knees! Open your scarf��d chops till I blow grit within you Spread your palms, and lift the flaps of your pockets I am not to be denied��I compel��I have stores plenty and to spare And anything I have I bestow. I do not ask who you are��that is not so important to me You can do nothing, and be nothing, but what I will infold you. To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean On his right cheek I put the family kiss, And in my soul I swear, I never will deny him. On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics. To any one dying��thither I speed, and twist the knob of the door Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed Let the physician and the priest go home. I seize the descending man, and raise him with resistless will. O despairer, here is my neck By God! you shall not go down! Hang your whole weight upon me. I dilate you with tremendous breath��I buoy you up Every room of the house do I fill with an arm��d force, Lovers of me, bafflers of graves. Sleep! I and they keep guard all night Not doubt��not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so. I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help. I heard what was said of the universe Heard it and heard it of several thousand years: It is middling well as far as it goes,��But is that all? Magnifying and applying come I, Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah, Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha, In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved, With Odin, and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and every idol and image Taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent more Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days They bore mites, as for unfledg��d birds, who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself�� bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see Discovering as much, or more, in a framer framing a house Putting higher claims for him there with his roll��d-up sleeves, driving the mallet and chisel Not objecting to special revelations��considering a curl of smoke, or a hair on the back of my hand, just as curious as any revelation Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the Gods of the antique wars Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction, Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr��d laths��their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames: By the mechanic��s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg��d out at their waists The snag-tooth��d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come, Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother, and sit by him while he is tried for forgery What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then The bull and the bug never worship��d half enough Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream��d The supernatural of no account��myself waiting my time to be one of the Supremes The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious: By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator Putting myself here and now to the ambush��d womb of the shadows. A call in the midst of the crowd My own voice, orotund, sweeping, and final. Come my children Come my boys and girls, my women, household, and intimates Now the performer launches his nerve��he has pass��d his prelude on the reeds within. Easily written, loose-finger��d chords! I feel the thrum of your climax and close. My head slues round on my neck Music rolls, but not from the organ Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine. Ever the hard, unsunk ground Ever the eaters and drinkers��ever the upward and downward sun��ever the air and the ceaseless tides Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real Ever the old inexplicable query��ever that thorn��d thumb��that breath of itches and thirsts Ever the vexer��s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides, and bring him forth Ever love��ever the sobbing liquid of life Ever the bandage under the chin��ever the tressels of death. Here and there, with dimes on the eyes, walking To feed the greed of the belly, the brains liberally spooning Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming. This is the city, and I am one of the citizens Whatever interests the rest interests me��politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools, Benevolent societies, improvements, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate, and personal estate. The little plentiful mannikins, skipping around in collars and tail��d coats, I am aware who they are��they are positively not worms or fleas. I acknowledge the duplicates of myself��the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me What I do and say, the same waits for them Every thought that flounders in me, the same flounders in them. I know perfectly well my own egotism I know my omnivorous lines, and will not write any less And would fetch you, whoever you are, flush with myself. No words of routine are mine, But abruptly to question, to leap beyond, yet nearer bring: This printed and bound book��but the printer, and the printing-office boy? The well-taken photographs��but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms? The black ship, mail��d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets��but the pluck of the captain and engineers? In the houses, the dishes and fare and furniture��but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes? The sky up there��yet here, or next door, or across the way? The saints and sages in history��but you yourself? Sermons, creeds, theology��but the fathomless human brain, And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life? I do not despise you, priests My faith is the greatest of faiths, and the least of faiths, Enclosing worship ancient and modern, and all between ancient and modern, Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years, Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the Gods, saluting the sun, Making a fetish of the first rock or stump, powwowing with sticks in the circle of obis, Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols, Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession��rapt and austere in the woods, a gymnosophist, Drinking mead from the skull-cup��to Shastas and Vedas admirant��minding the Koran, Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum, Accepting the Gospels��accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, To the mass kneeling, or the puritan��s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew, Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me, Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land, Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits. One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang, I turn and talk, like a man leaving charges before a journey. Down-hearted doubters, dull and excluded, Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten��d, atheistical I know every one of you��I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief. How the flukes splash! How they contort, rapid as lightning, with spasms, and spouts of blood! Be at peace, bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers I take my place among you as much as among any The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same, And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same. I do not know what is untried and afterward But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail. Each who passes is consider��d��each who stops is consider��d��not a single one can it fail. It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried, Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side, Nor the little child that peep��d in at the door, and then drew back, and was never seen again, Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, Nor him in the poor house, tubercled by rum and the bad disorder, Nor the numberless slaughter��d and wreck��d��nor the brutish koboo call��d the ordure of humanity, Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in, Nor anything in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth, Nor anything in the myriads of spheres��nor one of the myriads of myriads that inhabit them, Nor the present��nor the least wisp that is known. It is time to explain myself��Let us stand up. What is known I strip away I launch all men and women forward with me into THE UNKNOWN. The clock indicates the moment��but what does eternity indicate? We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them. Births have brought us richness and variety, And other births will bring us richness and variety. I do not call one greater and one smaller That which fills its period and place is equal to any. Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister? I am sorry for you��they are not murderous or jealous upon me All has been gentle with me��I keep no account with lamentation What have I to do with lamentation? I am an acme of things accomplish��d, and I an encloser of things to be. My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps All below duly travel��d, and still I mount and mount. Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me Afar down I see the huge first Nothing��I know I was even there I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist, And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon. Long I was hugg��d close��long and long. Immense have been the preparations for me, Faithful and friendly the arms that have help��d me. Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings They sent influences to look after what was to hold me. Before I was born out of my mother, generations guided me My embryo has never been torpid��nothing could overlay it. For it the nebula cohered to an orb, The long slow strata piled to rest it on, Vast vegetables gave it sustenance, Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths, and deposited it with care. All forces have been steadily employ��d to complete and delight me Now on this spot I stand with my robust Soul. O span of youth! Ever-push��d elasticity! O manhood, balanced, florid, and full. My lovers suffocate me! Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin, Jostling me through streets and public halls��coming naked to me at night, Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river��swinging and chirping over my head, Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush, Lighting on every moment of my life, Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses, Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts, and giving them to be mine. Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days! Every condition promulges not only itself��it promulges what grows after and out of itself, And the dark hush promulges as much as any. I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems, And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge but the rim of the farther systems. Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding, Outward and outward, and forever outward. My sun has his sun, and round him obediently wheels, He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit, And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them. There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run We should surely bring up again where we now stand, And as surely go as much farther��and then farther and farther. A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or make it impatient They are but parts��anything is but a part. See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that. My rendezvous is appointed��it is certain The Lord will be there, and wait till I come, on perfect terms The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine, will be there. I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured, and never will be measured. I tramp a perpetual journey��come listen all! My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair I have no chair, no church, no philosophy I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, or exchange But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll, My left hand hooking you round the waist, My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents, and a plain public road. Not I��not any one else, can travel that road for you, You must travel it for yourself. It is not far��it is within reach Perhaps you have been on it since you were born, and did not know Perhaps it is every where on water and on land. Shoulder your duds, dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth, Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go. If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip, And in due time you shall repay the same service to me For after we start, we never lie by again. This day before dawn I ascended a hill, and look��d at the crowded heaven, And I said to my Spirit, When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them, shall we be fill��d and satisfied then? And my Spirit said, No, we but level that life, to pass and continue beyond. You are also asking me questions, and I hear you I answer that I cannot answer��you must find out for yourself. Sit a while, dear son Here are biscuits to eat, and here is milk to drink But as soon as you sleep, and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-bye kiss, and open the gate for your egress hence. Long enough have you dream��d contemptible dreams Now I wash the gum from your eyes You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light, and of every moment of your life. Long have you timidly waded, holding a plank by the shore Now I will you to be a bold swimmer, To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair. I am the teacher of athletes He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own, proves the width of my own He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher. The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not through derived power, but in his own right, Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear, Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak, Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts, First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull��s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song, or play on the banjo, Preferring scars, and the beard, and faces pitted with small-pox, over all latherers, And those well tann��d to those that keep out of the sun. I teach straying from me��yet who can stray from me? I follow you, whoever you are, from the present hour My words itch at your ears till you understand them. I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat It is you talking just as much as myself��I act as the tongue of you Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen��d. I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house, And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air. If you would understand me, go to the heights or water-shore The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words. No shutter��d room or school can commune with me, But roughs and little children better than they. The young mechanic is closest to me��he knows me well The woodman, that takes his axe and jug with him, shall take me with him all day The farm-boy, ploughing in the field, feels good at the sound of my voice In vessels that sail, my words sail��I go with fishermen and seamen, and love them. The soldier camp��d, or upon the march, is mine On the night ere the pending battle, many seek me, and I do not fail them On the solemn night it may be their last, those that know me, seek me. My face rubs to the hunter��s face, when he lies down alone in his blanket The driver, thinking of me, does not mind the jolt of his wagon The young mother and old mother comprehend me The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment, and forget where they are They and all would resume what I have told them. I have said that the soul is not more than the body, And I have said that the body is not more than the soul And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one��s self is, And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy, walks to his own funeral, drest in his shroud, And I or you, pocketless of a dime, may purchase the pick of the earth, And to glance with an eye, or show a bean in its pod, confounds the learning of all times, And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero, And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel��d universe, And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes. And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God, For I, who am curious about each, am not curious about God No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God, and about death. I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least, Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself. Why should I wish to see God better than this day? I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass I find letters from God dropt in the street��and every one is sign��d by God��s name, And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe��er I go, Others will punctually come forever and ever. And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me. To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes I see the elder-hand, pressing, receiving, supporting I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors, And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape. And as to you, Corpse, I think you are good manure��but that does not offend me I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing, I reach to the leafy lips��I reach to the polish��d breasts of melons. And as to you Life, I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before. I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven O suns! O grass of graves! O perpetual transfers and promotions! If you do not say anything, how can I say anything? Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, Toss, sparkles of day and dusk! toss on the black stems that decay in the muck! Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs. I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small. There is that in me��I do not know what it is��but I know it is in me. Wrench��d and sweaty��calm and cool then my body becomes I sleep��I sleep long. I do not know it��it is without name��it is a word unsaid It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol. Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me. Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters. Do you see, O my brothers and sisters? It is not chaos or death��it is form, union, plan��it is eternal life��it is HAPPINESS. The past and present wilt��I have fill��d them, emptied them, And proceed to fill my next fold of the future. Listener up there! Here, you! What have you to confide to me? Look in my face, while I snuff the sidle of evening Talk honestly��no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer. Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself I am large��I contain multitudes. I concentrate toward them that are nigh��I wait on the door-slab. Who has done his day��s work? Who will soonest be through with his supper? Who wishes to walk with me? Will you speak before I am gone? Will you prove already too late? The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me��he complains of my gab and my loitering. I too am not a bit tamed��I too am untranslatable I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. The last scud of day holds back for me It flings my likeness after the rest, and true as any, on the shadow��d wilds It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk. I depart as air��I shake my white locks at the runaway sun I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags. I bequeathe myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles. You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood. Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged Missing me one place, search another I stop somewhere, waiting for you.","source":"modern_poetry","id":787},{"title":"Song at Sunset.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"SPLENDOR of ended day, floating and filling me.

As I muse, retrospective, murmuring a chant in thought, Lo! the war resumes��again to my sense your shapes, And again the advance of armies. Noiseless as mists and vapors, From their graves in the trenches ascending, From the cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee, From every point of the compass, out of the countless unnamed graves, In wafted clouds, in myraids large, or squads of twos or threes, or single ones, they come, And silently gather round me.

But aside from these, and the marts of wealth, and the crowded promenade, Admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and voiceless, The slain elate and alive again��the dust and debris alive, I chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead soldiers. Faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet Draw close, but speak not. Phantoms of countless lost! Invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions!

O harsh surrounding cloud, that will not free my soul!

In the swamp, in secluded recesses, A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. Solitary, the thrush, The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, Sings by himself a song. Song of the bleeding throat! Death��s outlet song of life��for well, dear brother, I know If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would��st surely die.

I cover you over with roses and early lilies But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, For you, and the coffins all of you, O death. O western orb, sailing the heaven! Now I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walk��d, As we walk��d up and down in the dark blue so mystic, As we walk��d in silence the transparent shadowy night, As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night, As you droop��d from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the other stars all look��d on As we wander��d together the solemn night, for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how full you were of woe As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold transparent night, As I watch��d where you pass��d and was lost in the netherward black of the night, As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb, Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone. Sing on, there in the swamp! O singer bashful and tender! I hear your notes��I hear your call I hear��I come presently��I understand you But a moment I linger��for the lustrous star has detain��d me The star, my departing comrade, holds and detains me. O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved? And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone? And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love? Sea-winds, blown from east and west, Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting: These, and with these, and the breath of my chant, I perfume the grave of him I love. O what shall I hang on the chamber walls? And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, To adorn the burial-house of him I love? Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes, With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning. Lo! body and soul! this land! Mighty Manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships The varied and ample land��the South and the North in the light��Ohio��s shores, and flashing Missouri, And ever the far-spreading prairies, cover��d with grass and corn. Lo! the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty The violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes The gentle, soft-born, measureless light The miracle, spreading, bathing all��the fulfill��d noon The coming eve, delicious��the welcome night, and the stars, Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. Sing on! sing on, you gray-brown bird! Sing from the swamps, the recesses��pour your chant from the bushes Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines. Sing on, dearest brother��warble your reedy song Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe. O liquid, and free, and tender! O wild and loose to my soul! O wondrous singer! You only I hear......yet the star holds me, but will soon depart Yet the lilac, with mastering odor, holds me. Now while I sat in the day, and look��d forth, In the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the farmer preparing his crops, In the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests, In the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturb��d winds, and the storms Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides,��and I saw the ships how they sail��d, And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages And the streets, how their throbbings throbb��d, and the cities pent��lo! then and there, Falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, Appear��d the cloud, appear��d the long black trail And I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, And I in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not, Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still. And the singer so shy to the rest receiv��d me The gray-brown bird I know, receiv��d us comrades three And he sang what seem��d the carol of death, and a verse for him I love. From deep secluded recesses, From the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still, Came the carol of the bird. And the charm of the carol rapt me, As I held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird. DEATH CAROL. Come, lovely and soothing Death, Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or later, delicate Death. Prais��d be the fathomless universe, For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious And for love, sweet love��But praise! praise! praise! For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death. Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet, Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? Then I chant it for thee��I glorify thee above all I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. Approach, strong Deliveress! When it is so��when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead, Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee, Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death. From me to thee glad serenades, Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee��adornments and feastings for thee And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting, And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night. The night, in silence, under many a star The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil��d Death, And the body gratefully nestling close to thee. Over the tree-tops I float thee a song! Over the rising and sinking waves��over the myriad fields, and the prairies wide Over the dense-pack��d cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways, I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death! To the tally of my soul, Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, With pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night. Loud in the pines and cedars dim, Clear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume And I with my comrades there in the night. While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, As to long panoramas of visions. I saw askant the armies And I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierc��d with missiles, I saw them, And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, and all in silence, And the staffs all splinter��d and broken. I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, And the white skeletons of young men��I saw them I saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war But I saw they were not as was thought They themselves were fully at rest��they suffer��d not The living remain��d and suffer��d��the mother suffer��d, And the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffer��d, And the armies that remain��d suffer��d. Passing the visions, passing the night Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades�� hands Passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul, Victorious song, death��s outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering song, As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, Covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven, As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, Passing, I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring, I cease from my song for thee From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, O comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night. Yet each I keep, and all, retrievements out of the night The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, And the tallying chant, the echo arous��d in my soul, With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe, With the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor With the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird, Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep��for the dead I loved so well For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for his dear sake Lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim.","source":"modern_poetry","id":794},{"title":"Adieu to a Soldier.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"ADIEU, O soldier.

Once, Paumanok, When the snows had melted��when the lilac-scent was in the air, and the Fifth-month grass was growing, Up this sea-shore, in some briers, Two guests from Alabama��two together, And their nest, and four light-green eggs, spotted with brown, And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand, And every day the she-bird, crouch��d on her nest, silent, with bright eyes, And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them, Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating. Shine. shine! shine! Pour down your warmth, great Sun! While we bask��we two together. Two together! Winds blow South, or winds blow North, Day come white, or night come black, Home, or rivers and mountains from home, Singing all time, minding no time, While we two keep together. Till of a sudden, May-be kill��d, unknown to her mate, One forenoon the she-bird crouch��d not on the nest, Nor return��d that afternoon, nor the next, Nor ever appear��d again. And thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea, And at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather, Over the hoarse surging of the sea, Or flitting from brier to brier by day, I saw, I heard at intervals, the remaining one, the he-bird, The solitary guest from Alabama.

Yes, my brother, I know The rest might not��but I have treasur��d every note For once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding, Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows, Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts, The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing, I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair, Listen��d long and long. Listen��d, to keep, to sing��now translating the notes, Following you, my brother. Soothe! soothe! soothe! Close on its wave soothes the wave behind, And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close, But my love soothes not me, not me. Low hangs the moon��it rose late O it is lagging��O I think it is heavy with love, with love. O madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land, With love��with love. O night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among the breakers? What is that little black thing I see there in the white? Loud! loud! loud! Loud I call to you, my love! High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves Surely you must know who is here, is here You must know who I am, my love. Low-hanging moon! What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow? O it is the shape, the shape of my mate! O moon, do not keep her from me any longer. Land! land! O land! Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look. O rising stars! Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you. O throat! O trembling throat! Sound clearer through the atmosphere! Pierce the woods, the earth Somewhere listening to catch you, must be the one I want. Shake out, carols! Solitary here��the night��s carols! Carols of lonesome love! Death��s carols! Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon! O, under that moon, where she droops almost down into the sea! O reckless, despairing carols. But soft! sink low Soft! let me just murmur And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me, So faint��I must be still, be still to listen But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me. Hither, my love! Here I am! Here! With this just-sustain��d note I announce myself to you This gentle call is for you, my love, for you. Do not be decoy��d elsewhere! That is the whistle of the wind��it is not my voice That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray Those are the shadows of leaves. O darkness! O in vain! O I am very sick and sorrowful. O brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon the sea! O troubled reflection in the sea! O throat! O throbbing heart! O all��and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night. Yet I murmur, murmur on! O murmurs��you yourselves make me continue to sing, I know not why. O past! O life! O songs of joy! In the air��in the woods��over fields Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved! But my love no more, no more with me! We two together no more. The aria sinking All else continuing��the stars shining, The winds blowing��the notes of the bird continuous echoing, With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning, On the sands of Paumanok��s shore, gray and rustling The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching The boy extatic��with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying, The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting, The aria��s meaning, the ears, the Soul, swiftly depositing, The strange tears down the cheeks coursing, The colloquy there��the trio��each uttering, The undertone��the savage old mother, incessantly crying, To the boy��s Soul��s questions sullenly timing��some drown��d secret hissing, To the outsetting bard of love. Demon or bird! said the boy��s soul, Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me? For I, that was a child, my tongue��s use sleeping, Now I have heard you, Now in a moment I know what I am for��I awake, And already a thousand singers��a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours, A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, Never to die. O you singer, solitary, singing by yourself��projecting me O solitary me, listening��nevermore shall I cease perpetuating you Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations, Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me, Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there, in the night, By the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon, The messenger there arous��d��the fire, the sweet hell within, The unknown want, the destiny of me. O give me the clew! it lurks in the night here somewhere O if I am to have so much, let me have more! O a word! O what is my destination? I fear it is henceforth chaos O how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes, and all shapes, spring as from graves around me! O phantoms! you cover all the land and all the sea! O I cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me O vapor, a look, a word! O well-beloved! O you dear women��s and men��s phantoms! A word then, for I will conquer it, The word final, superior to all, Subtle, sent up��what is it?��I listen Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves? Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands? Whereto answering, the sea, Delaying not, hurrying not, Whisper��d me through the night, and very plainly before day-break, Lisp��d to me the low and delicious word DEATH And again Death��ever Death, Death, Death, Hissing melodious, neither like the bird, nor like my arous��d child��s heart, But edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet, Creeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all over, Death, Death, Death, Death, Death. Which I do not forget, But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother, That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok��s gray beach, With the thousand responsive songs, at random, My own songs, awaked from that hour And with them the key, the word up from the waves, The word of the sweetest song, and all songs, That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet, The sea whisper��d me.","source":"modern_poetry","id":806},{"title":"I Sing the Body Electric.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"I SING the Body electric The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul. Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? And if the body does not do as much as the Soul? And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul? The love of the Body of man or woman balks account��the body itself balks account That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. The expression of the face balks account But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees��dress does not hide him The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats��the horseman in his saddle, Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, The female soothing a child��the farmer��s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, The young fellow hoeing corn��the sleigh-driver guiding his six horses through the crowd, The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown, after work, The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, The upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, The natural, perfect, varied attitudes��the bent head, the curv��d neck, and the counting Such-like I love��I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother��s breast with the little child, Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, and count. I know a man, a common farmer��the father of five sons And in them were the fathers of sons��and in them were the fathers of sons. This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes��the richness and breadth of his manners, These I used to go and visit him to see��he was wise also He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old��his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome They and his daughters loved him��all who saw him loved him They did not love him by allowance��they loved him with personal love He drank water only��the blood show��d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face He was a frequent gunner and fisher��he sail��d his boat himself��he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner��he had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that loved him When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang. You would wish long and long to be with him��you would wish to sit by him in the boat, that you and he might touch each other. I have perceiv��d that to be with those I like is enough, To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment��what is this, then? I do not ask any more delight��I swim in it, as in a sea. There is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well All things please the soul��but these please the soul well. This is the female form A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction. I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor��all falls aside but myself and it Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds, and what was expected of heaven or fear��d of hell, are now consumed Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it��the response likewise ungovernable Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused��mine too diffused Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb��love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice Bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn Undulating into the willing and yielding day, Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh��d day. This is the nucleus��after the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman This is the bath of birth��this is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. Be not ashamed, women��your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. The female contains all qualities, and tempers them��she is in her place, and moves with perfect balance She is all things duly veil��d��she is both passive and active She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. As I see my soul reflected in nature As I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty, See the bent head, and arms folded over the breast��the female I see. The male is not less the soul, nor more��he too is in his place He too is all qualities��he is action and power The flush of the known universe is in him Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him well��pride is for him The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul Knowledge becomes him��he likes it always��he brings everything to the test of himself Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only here Where else does he strike soundings, except here? The man��s body is sacred, and the woman��s body is sacred No matter who it is, it is sacred Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well-off��just as much as you Each has his or her place in the procession. All is a procession The universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion. Do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull-face ignorant? Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float��and the soil is on the surface, and water runs, and vegetation sprouts, For you only, and not for him and her? A man��s Body at auction I help the auctioneer��the sloven does not half know his business. Gentlemen, look on this wonder! Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one animal or plant For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll��d. In this head the all-baffling brain In it and below it, the makings of heroes. Examine these limbs, red, black, or white��they are so cunning in tendon and nerve They shall be stript, that you may see them. Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, And wonders within there yet. Within there runs blood, The same old blood! The same red-running blood! There swells and jets a heart��there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations Do you think they are not there because they are not express��d in parlors and lecture-rooms? This is not only one man��this is the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns In him the start of populous states and rich republics Of him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and enjoyments. How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries? A woman��s Body at auction! She too is not only herself��she is the teeming mother of mothers She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. Have you ever loved the Body of a woman? Have you ever loved the Body of a man? Your father��where is your father? Your mother��is she living? have you been much with her? and has she been much with you? ��Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all nations and times, all over the earth? If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred, And the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful as the most beautiful face. Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. O my Body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the Soul, and that they are the Soul I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems��and that they are poems, Man��s, woman��s, child��s, youth��s, wife��s, husband��s, mother��s, father��s, young man��s, young woman��s poems Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest. Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, finger-balls, finger-joints, finger-nails, Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone, Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg, Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body, or of any one��s body, male or female, The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, Womanhood, and all that is a woman��and the man that comes from woman, The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair, The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out, The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, The thin red jellies within you, or within me��the bones, and the marrow in the bones, The exquisite realization of health O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul, O I say now these are the Soul!","source":"modern_poetry","id":807}]
